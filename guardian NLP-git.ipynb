       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Weakened and distrusted central governments around the world have been incapable of responding to the way the internet and social media have empowered populist but previously fringe groups, a unique worldwide survey of government communication chiefs has found.</p> <p>The survey spanning 40 countries is the first international review to reveal how deeply governments feel they are losing control and authority over communications.</p> <p>It shows they have been collectively shaken by public distrust of governments, and are struggling to keep pace with how modern voters gather information and form their opinions. The advent of fake news, the dissemination of knowingly inaccurate news, has only deepened the crisis.</p> <p>The study synthesising the responses of more than 300 communication chiefs was undertaken by the advertising and strategy group WPP and steered by a global advisory board spanning Australia, Europe, Asia and America, including leading academics and practitioners in communications, business and the public sector. Prof Ngaire Woods, dean of the Blavatnik school of government at Oxford University, contributed from the UK.</p> <p>The shrinking of the centre’s power and its inability to communicate effectively has fuelled populism, radicalisation and extremism, the survey finds.</p> <p>“When people feel ignored, unheard and unrepresented they turn to alternative sources of information. If governments do not communicate with citizens properly, citizens will go somewhere elsewhere for information,” the report says. </p> <p>The study, entitled Leader’s Report: The Future of Government Communications, finds “the internet has loosened government’s historical and collective grip on trust. It has transformed the role of government as providers of information. Social media has created an echo chamber of information than can filter out opposing views and commentary. </p> <p>“It has created a sense that all information’s free and equal. Citizens find it increasingly easy to communicate with one another, helping once marginalised groups create vocal and powerful social organisations. The technology has fractured audiences and enabled misinformation to be corroborated by anonymous users and politicians alike at ever increasing speeds.” </p> <p>It adds: “Extreme views can appear more mainstream when algorithms amplify them and reflect them back to others with similar views.” </p> <p>Despite this glut of information, the communication managers claim the public feel “more apprehensive than perhaps at any time since the end of the cold war”. The report suggests that “citizens are more powerful than ever in terms of unlimited access to information and can garner support on issues from like-minded individuals faster than the speed with which even the nimblest administration can respond. They have more up-to-date tech than most governments.” </p> <p>The communication chiefs also admit they lack capacity in terms of skills and numbers to be able to connect with citizens, and move to a form of meaningful two-way communication. By contrast governments appear inward-looking and policy-focused.</p> <p>Changes to the media, noticeably the rise of social media, have led to a shrinking of the centre. Groups can establish themselves effectively in opposition to government with very few resources. Such groups do not require the checks and balances that governments need to go through before they respond. </p> <p>One result the study suggests is a more combative relationship between sections of the public and governments.</p> <p>In seeking solutions, the WPP study claims governments face a long haul, but can only respond by being more, not less open, and by providing real-time access to government and those who govern. It suggests they need to do more to distinguish between politicised and government information, and switch from a reliance on mass uniform broadcasting to a more personalised segmented communication.</p> <p> The survey group admits its colleagues in government are not citizen-focused, with only a quarter saying the voice of the citizen is taken into account in key decisions. </p> <p> They complain that communications are seen as little more than a final car wash, the tail end that polishes up a policy that has been produced away from the public or any citizen engagement. </p>',\n",

An app that costs $0.99 in the US, and used to cost £0.79, will now cost £0.99.</p> <p>Apple announced the price rises in an email to app developers on Tuesday, and told them “when foreign exchange rates or taxation changes, we sometimes need to update prices on the App Store”. It says the new prices will roll out over the next seven days, giving customers a short opportunity to beat the price increase.</p> <p>Similar price increases are expected to hit other Apple stores, including the iTunes Store for music and video and the iBooks Store.</p> <p>Britain isn’t the only country experiencing price changes. India is seeing price increases due to changes in service taxes, while Turkish prices are also rising due to depreciation of the Turkish Lira. <br /></p> <p>Since the vote to leave the European Union, the value of the pound has fallen by 18.5% against the US dollar. Apple has already acted to change other British prices since the vote to leave the European Union: in October, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/brexit-apple-mac-customers-prices-rise-us-dollar-pound-sterling\">it marked the launch of new Macs with a 20% price rise</a> across the line. One computer, the Mac Pro, saw its price jump by £500 overnight.<br /></p> <p>In a statement, Apple said: “Price tiers on the App Store are set internationally on the basis of several factors, including currency exchange rates, business practices, taxes and the cost of doing business. These factors vary from region to region and over time.”</p> <p>The price rises were announced the same day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/17/uk-inflation-hits-two-year-high\">UK inflation surged to 1.6%</a>, higher than expected.

The analogy with corporate personhood is unfortunate, as this has not protected society in general, but allowed owners of companies to further their own interests – witness the example of the Citizens United movement in the US, where corporate personhood has been used as a tool for companies to interfere in the electoral process, on the basis that a corporation has the same right to free speech as a biological human being.</p> <p>Electronic personhood will protect the interests of a few, at the expense of the many.

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Tesla owners will be able to ask the robot that drives their car to break the speed limit, again, following a software update pushed out to users over the weekend.</p> <p>The new software changes the way the autopilot function works on Tesla cars equipped with it. The brand covers a suite of advanced safety features, from lane assist, which keeps the car in the correct lane when driving on motorways, to adaptive cruise control, which allows the car to match speeds with the vehicle in front.</p> <p>In December, a software update was pushed out which limited the speed on roads without a central divider: cars could not be set to go faster than the speed limit. At the time, Tesla Motors’ chief executive, Elon Musk, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/812441273013452800\">said that</a> there was “no major precipitating event” for the change, but that “people in general were going a bit too fast on winding roads”.</p> <p>Now, that update has been reversed, allowing Tesla Motors owners to return to breaking the speed limit. The car is still capped at five miles per hour faster than the limit on non-divided roads, however.</p> <p>On highways, the limit is rather higher: autopilot can be set up to 90mph, regardless of the actual speed limit on the road.</p> <p>Tesla owners, many of whom had expressed irritation at the original limiter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/819663998878564352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">responded to Musk’s confirmation of the change</a> with glee. “Yay! I can keep my car!,” wrote one. “Looks like owner outrage and certain well known people tweeting Tesla does in fact get results,” <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/5nlgar/new_software_update_25222_rolls_back_hard_speed/dcchimn/\">said another owner on Reddit</a>.</p> <p>The Guardian asked Tesla whether it approves of owners commanding their personal robots to drive them faster than the law permits. </p> <p>In a statement, the company said: “Autopilot is designed as a hands-on experience to give drivers more confidence behind the wheel, increase their safety on the road and make motorway driving more enjoyable by reducing the driver’s workload. </p> <p>“Tesla vehicles are constantly evolving in their capabilities and features sets. With the current feature set, Tesla Autopilot is classified as Level 2 automated system. Until full autonomy is reached, the driver is responsible for and must remain in control of their car at all times.”</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Lily Robotics, the defunct manufacturer of the world’s first “selfie drone”, is being sued over allegations that it faked product shots and misled consumers about the capability of its prototype devices.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/01/16/05702434-Page0-36.pdf\">lawsuit alleges</a> that videos on Lily’s website, presented as though they had been taken by the drone, were in fact shot by a mixture of GoPro cameras and DJI drones, a competitor model that costs up to four times as much and requires a skilled filmmaker to manually control the camera.</p> <p>The San Francisco District Attorney’s (SFDA) office filed the case on Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/12/selfie-drone-company-shut-down-despite-34m-pre-orders\">the day after Lily announced it was shutting down</a> and refunding customers who had pre-ordered its drone at prices ranging from $499 to $899.</p> <p>Promotional videos detailed a number of groundbreaking capabilities of the Lily drone: the ability to take off from, and land on, a user’s outstretched hand; a waterproof casing to enable water-based launches; and most impressively, autopilot mode that could allow the drone to follow the user at a set distance and automatically film them.</p> <p>In the videos, a drone operating under the autopilot setting was shown following people engaged in extreme sports such as snowboarding and white water kayaking. But the SFDA alleges that those videos were not shot with anything like the equipment that Lily promised to customers.</p> <p>In court documents, the DA says that despite “implicit and explicit representations that a Lily Camera was used to film those portions … that are seen from the point of view of a Lily,” but they were in fact “filmed by a much more expensive, professional camera drone (the DJI Inspire).”</p> <p>The complaint continues: “The DJI Inspire was the opposite of the ‘autonomous’ camera that Lily Robotics was touting. In order to achieve the POV video, the DJI Inspire required two people to operate and film those shots.”</p> <p>According to emails quoted in the complaint, other footage was shot using a GoPro camera mounted to a Lily prototype. In the emails, the company’s co-founder Antoine Balaresque expresses concern that viewers could be able to tell.</p> <p>“I am worried that a lens geek could study our images up close and detect the unique GoPro lens footprint,” the complaint quotes him as saying. “But I am just speculating here: I don’t know much about lenses but I think we should be extremely careful if we decide to lie publicly.”</p> <p>As a result of the alleged wrongdoing, the SFDA is asking for the courts to fine Lily $2,500 for each individual violation.</p> <p>Lily is offering a refund to customers over the next 60 days. The company has not yet responded to request for comment. </p>',\n",

Now an independent space-faring nation, albeit with a fractional budget, it’s up to the bumbling Captain English and his sarcastic, and very Welsh, Sub-Lieutenant Jones to find new planets to colonise for a galactic British empire.</p> <p>Mechanically, <em>Her Majesty’s Spiffing </em>is both love letter and update to the point-and-click adventures of old. Players freely guide English – who makes Boris Johnson’s role as foreign secretary look like a wise appointment – around his hilariously rundown ship and unlikely alien worlds, investigating objects and solving puzzles through an intuitive command wheel. <em>HMS</em> is modern enough for younger players, but retains the DNA of classic adventure games.</p> <p>However, its greatest strengths are a witty script and a wry political edge that cuts especially post-Brexit vote. In lampooning an isolationist Britain, it is the court jester speaking truth to power. <strong>MK</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1b613726860d8e4b9e54616bbe60cc1bb65394e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1b613726860d8e4b9e54616bbe60cc1bb65394e/0_0_1280_800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Beautiful and compelling’: Super Mario Run.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Beautiful and compelling’: Super Mario Run.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://supermariorun.com/en/index.html\"><strong>Super Mario Run</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>iOS, Nintendo, cert: 4</strong><br />★★★★</p> <p>Mario’s smartphone debut may have been somewhat swamped by the Christmas rush of releases, but this was one of the best games of 2016.</p> <p>Unlike console Mario titles, players just need to tap the screen to control the plumber’s jumping, with running occurring automatically. It’s not as simple as it looks – timing and length of presses are crucial in overcoming the 24 levels. While the story mode is relatively short-lived (although grabbing those elusive black coins offers plenty of replayability), longevity comes from Toad Rally – a competitive game where players must collect more coins than their online rivals. Winning rallies results in Toads populating and expanding the kingdom.</p> <p>However, although there are no microtransactions required, the £7.99 cost is steep for a mobile game and <em>Super Mario Run</em> also inexplicably requires an internet connection, which can cause frustration when the signal drops. These issues aside, though, Nintendo has crafted a beautiful and compelling Mario game more than worthy of its bigger console counterparts. <strong>CD</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cf6d46c53da2f7eeb37d4a48a56767bae37eb2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cf6d46c53da2f7eeb37d4a48a56767bae37eb2a/34_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Don Bradman Cricket 17\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘An impressive simulation’: Don Bradman Cricket 17</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.donbradmancricket17.com/\"><strong>Don Bradman Cricket 17</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>PS4, Xbox One, Big Ant Studios, cert: 3</strong><br />★★★★</p> <p>Next-gen cricket games are rarer than an England Test victory in India, so the developers of the latest iteration in the <em>Don Bradman</em> series could be forgiven for just going through the motions, safe in the knowledge that they have a captive market.</p> <p>Fortunately for cricket-lovers, this is not the case with Big Ant Studios. They have produced an impressive simulation – no simple feat given the complexity of the game – and while the controls do take time to master, the reward for putting in the effort is huge depth and a wide range of options when batting or bowling.</p> <p>The graphics might not strain a modern console’s processing power, but this is more than made up for by top-notch gameplay. The career mode, where a player can start at club level and work their way up to a county side and eventually international selection, is very immersive and promises plenty of replayability.</p> <p>Equally, the range of different game modes should be enough for any cricket fan, with everything from a five-over thrash to a five-day Test available, and it is good to see that a wide range of women’s teams have been included.</p> <p>The lack of correct player names is an annoyance, although this can be easily fixed – there is a detailed editor included which means almost anything in the game can be tweaked. This even allows for creation of new teams, tournaments or stadiums, offering more than enough to keep cricket fans occupied during the cold winter months. <strong>RF</strong></p>',\n",

Over the next decade, accelerating autonomous driving technology, including advances in artificial intelligence, sensors, cameras, radar and data analytics, are set to transform not only how we drive (or, indeed, are driven), but the notion of car ownership itself. “Autonomous driving has become the next major battlefield for the car industry,” says Luca Mentuccia, automotive global MD at Accenture.</p> <p>The six levels of automation, defined under international standards <a href=\"https://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf\">by the Society of Automotive Engineers</a>, range from “no automation” to “full automation”, explains Sven Raeymaekers, of tech investment banker GP Bullhound. “If you look at the most recent predictions, the majority of car manufacturers estimate the first highly to fully automated vehicles [AVs] will hit the market between 2020-2025,” he says. </p> <p>When they do, regulatory approval permitting, their most significant impact is likely to be in the area of urban mobility. “AVs will enable new service configurations where consumers are delivered door to door with virtually no stops in a comfortable vehicle with just one to three other passengers,” says Stan Boland, CEO of FiveAI, which builds AI-driven software for AVs and is one of the companies testing autonomous vehicles on UK roads in 2017, alongside major manufacturers including Volvo and Ford.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/25/uber-self-driving-cars-pittsburgh-how-driverless-cars-could-change-our-future-lyft-john-zimmer\">How driverless cars could change our whole future | John Naughton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such services will be safer, reduce pollution and congestion, and will also bring about a paradigm shift in personal vehicle ownership rates, which are likely to decline steeply, he says. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/09/fewer-car-owners-more-driverless-vehicles-future-survey-reveals\">recent survey of car manufacturing executives</a> by KPMG similarly revealed that 59% of industry bosses believe that more than half of all car owners today will no longer want to own a car by 2025.</p> <p>So how exactly will we be getting about by the end of the next decade? Will automation really “solve” crashes, and what other sorts of AVs are we likely to see on our roads? The <em>Observer</em> asked a panel of experts about the likely realities and practicalities of driving in the year 2030.</p> <h2>Will I be a driver or a passenger?</h2> <p>You’ll have a choice, says Dr Nick Reed, academy director at transport consultancy TRL. “If you want to drive an MG and enjoy that, you’ll be able to. Or if you want to prepare for a business meeting during your two-hour journey, you’ll be able to do that too. Automation systems give us choices.”</p> <p>Nikolaus Lang, of the Boston Consulting Group’s Centre for Digital in Automotive, argues it will depend on the vehicle you’re in. “By 2030, you’ll be a ‘controlling passenger’ in your private self-driving car and you’ll be a ‘complete passenger’ in a robo-taxi.”</p> <h2><strong>Will it still make sense to own a car or will I rent one (on demand)?</strong></h2> <p>Instead of today’s car ownership model, we are far more likely to rely on “mobility as a service” by 2030, says Boland. “Imagine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/22/uber-self-driving-car-san-francisco-arizona\">an Uber-like service</a> you can summon at the touch of a button, but without a driver. Renting is not necessarily the right word – consumers will buy a service like using an Uber today, but with a wider range of vehicle configurations to suit different types of travel – family outings, long-distance sleeper travel, or shared commutes.”</p> <p>However, Lang points out that there’s a clear difference between a young urban population, for whom owning cars makes little sense, and the millions of suburbanites with families, who will probably still opt to own.</p> <h2><strong>Will there still be crashes?</strong></h2> <p>A 2008 survey by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that human error is the critical reason for 93% of crashes, says Boland. “When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/04/driverless-cars-boris-johnson-stallion-road-safety\">you eliminate human error</a>, our roads become dramatically safer: no more drink-driving, phone calls at the wheel, carelessness, inattention or plain bad driving. Clearly there needs to be adequate industry testing to ensure that AVs are safe for all other road users, but we can look forward to far safer roads as human drivers become a thing of the past.”</p> <h2><strong>Will all cars be electric?</strong></h2> <p>“I don’t think all of them will be electric by 2030,” says Danny Shapiro, senior director at NVIDIA, whose AI computer platform powers the supercomputer in Tesla vehicles. “Virtually every startup is looking at electric, and you have ever greater electric and hybrid focus from German, Japanese and US [manufacturers]. But at the same time there’s still a huge oil infrastructure. And, at least for the next four years, there’s a very pro-oil administration in the US.”</p> <p>Yet Bosch is developing a lithium-ion solid state battery that they hope will double the range of electric vehicles at half the cost of today’s batteries, which Steffen Hoffmann, the corporation’s UK president, believes will increase take-up among those who live in the suburbs and beyond. “We have a projection that by 2025, globally 15% of vehicles are going to have an electric component, whether that’s a pure electric vehicle, a plug-in hybrid or full hybrid,” he says. “For western Europe, that percentage would obviously be higher.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02e5ee242124761827c0f113afeff28ee13458b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02e5ee242124761827c0f113afeff28ee13458b2/0_184_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Honda NeuV concept vehicle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Honda NeuV concept vehicle at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Mcnew/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Will there still be driving tests?</strong></h2> <p>“Yes,” says Reed. “But they might be very different, with different layers. Just as you have an automatic and a manual gearbox test today, there might be an automated driving test which may only entitle you to ‘drive’ a certain type of vehicle that has certain automation systems, rather than any vehicle. Drivers will need to understand how to operate those systems – so there may also be different skills required as part of the test.”</p> <h2><strong>Will there be less gridlock?</strong></h2> <p>“With a heterogeneous mix of vehicle configurations and on-demand service delivery, autonomous vehicles will enable a higher density of passengers per road mile,” says Boland. “Also, because AVs can travel safely closer together, and with less braking and accelerating than human drivers, traffic will flow more smoothly and congestion will decrease. On motorways more vehicles will be able to fit safely into the same length of road, effectively increasing capacity”.</p> <p>Shapiro adds that another key cause of congestion is accidents. “Even if [the accident] isn’t blocking lanes, the traffic slows down to see what’s going on. So self-driving cars will not only enable more efficient flow, but they’ll remove the accident side of congestion [as there will be fewer of them].”</p> <h2><strong>Will automated vehicles be vulnerable to hackers?</strong></h2> <p>By definition, a driverless car has more control units, computing power, lines of code, and wireless connections with the outside world than a regular car today, which is why it’s more vulnerable to hackers, explains Andy Birnie, systems engineering manager at NXP Semiconductors. “A hacker can potentially take control of the car, through exploitation of a weakness, and could cause the vehicle to refuse to start, or to crash, or it could exploit the privacy of the driver, and [their] data, including financial information.”</p> <p>However, a shift in the approach to security is under way, he says. “There is now more focus on the basics – applying good fundamental security to the critical areas including the interfaces that connect the vehicle to the external world; gateways, which separate safety critical systems from other car and infotainment systems; and networks that provide secure communication between control units – there can be over 150 in an autonomous vehicle.” In addition, major advances to security include “over-the-air” software updates that can patch vulnerabilities seamlessly in real time, Birnie says.</p> <h2><strong>Will I still need insurance (as a vehicle owner)?</strong></h2> <p>“Yes,” says Niall Edwards, partner at international law firm Kennedys. Fully autonomous vehicles are likely to be considered a different class of vehicle that requires additional compulsory insurance cover, he says.</p> <p>“The most likely product will be a package underwritten by a motor insurer that the manufacturer offers at the point of purchase, use or hire.” One possibility is that new vehicles fitted with advanced-driver technology will automatically come with a form of product liability and extended cover provided by the manufacturer.</p> <p>The good news, says Allianz UK’s Glen Clarke, is that because semi- and fully autonomous cars are expected to lead to a fall in accidents, we are likely to see a drop in premiums. “The price you pay will be much more influenced by the technical capabilities of the car as opposed to estimations of the riskiness of the driver.”</p> <h2>How will the law adapt to autonomous vehicles?</h2> <p>Currently, UK law anticipates the existence of a “driver” who is in control of the vehicle at all times, says Rachel Moore, also a partner at Kennedys. Regulations on vehicle use will therefore need to be revised to allow the use of automotive technology without a driver and – crucially – to ensure that the technology is maintained correctly.</p> <p>To start with, Moore continues, the Road Traffic Act (1988) is likely to be amended to include product liability for automated vehicles. “Other changes will be required, including to the Highway Code and international regulations on vehicle use. We may also see changes to the MOT to check roadworthiness.”</p> <h2><strong>Do AVs reduce the risks for pedestrians and cyclists?</strong></h2> <p>We’re only at the start of understanding how pedestrians and cyclists will interact with a vehicle that doesn’t have a human driver at the controls, says Reed. “Whether a pedestrian will be able to detect whether a car is automated or not, and adapt their behaviour accordingly, we still don’t know.”</p> <p>Lang argues that there’s a risk, initially at least, that pedestrians and cyclists may try to “test” AVs to see how they react. “In Singapore, they are currently testing autonomous vehicles in public parks and they tell us that the large majority of incidents [near misses] are not due to the vehicles malfunctioning, but to people jumping in front of the cars to test whether they stop in time.”</p> <p>Mixed traffic carries risk, he continues, just as there may be risks associated with behavioural patterns we cannot foresee. “As with any new technology, there will be failures and even fatalities, but the overall benefits – in terms of [estimated] 90% fewer accidents, 40% less congestion, up to 80% less emissions, and 50% of parking space saved – are so substantial that the technological development will prevail.”</p> <h2><strong>What other autonomous vehicles might we see on our roads?</strong></h2> <p>From vertical take-off and landing “flying car” prototypes to “sidewalk robots” and delivery drones, by 2030 our roads and pavements may have begun to resemble a scene from <em>Blade Runner</em>.</p> <p>“Driverless trucks are already being tested around the world, with Daimler testing on public roads in the US and Germany in 2016,” says Boland. Bosch meanwhile, envisages that a truck will become “a 40-tonne smart device on wheels” by 2025. “[The trucks] will receive all the data they need in real time from the Bosch IoT cloud, including information on the route, congestion, detours, and unloading facilities at the destination,” says Hoffmann. “This will allow the driver to get on with other things [such as processing shipping documents], while the truck drives itself.”</p> <h2>Car v tech giants: who will win?</h2> <p>Today’s AV sector is a crowded space. It’s estimated that at least 33 tech and auto corporations, ranging from Apple to Chinese bus manufacturer Yutong – via the likes of Audi, BMW, Google, Honda, Intel, Tesla, Uber and Volkswagen – are currently developing AV technology.</p> <p>With the $2tn global car industry in the throes of transformation due to a perfect storm of digitisation, AI/automation and changes in consumer behaviour – such as the rise of on-demand taxi services in urban centres – it’s not difficult to see why car manufacturers, tech companies and investors are scrambling for territory, fearful of being left out. “All this change creates both risk and opportunity for incumbents,” says GP Bullhound’s Sven Raeymaekers. So who does he see coming out on top?</p> <p>“Some pundits claim that since the car industry has historically only focused on the internal combustion engine and shell design, it has no chance against the tsunami of software moving towards their shores. But so many industries have already suffered from this onslaught, and the automakers have no plans to see history repeat itself,” he says. “Across the board, major players – Renault-Nissan, Ford, BMW, Daimler and GM, to name a few - are investing in and developing their own technologies, hiring talent or acquiring startups. From GM <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/06/lyft-driverless-cars-uber-taxis-us-roads-chevrolet-bolt\">investing $500m in Lyft </a>to the creation of Ford Smart Mobility, every single big manufacturer is looking to innovate and adapt.”</p> <p>Besides, any notion of a race between tech firms and traditional car makers is a false perception, argues Accenture’s Luca Mentuccia. He predicts a surge of strategic cooperation instead. “We will see even more cross-industry partnerships for autonomous driving in the future in which car makers and a large range of tech firms from chipmakers to big data specialists, telcos and mobility platforms will work together.”</p>',\n",

And what a car it is over there. With your stetson tossed in the back, smoked rib juice staining your checked shirt and <a href=\"http://www.johnnycash.com/\">Johnny Cash</a> cranked up, the car’s played a starring role in many of our cowboy fantasies. Now, at last, Ford has swapped the steering wheel to the right and unleashed its wild horse in the UK. Which is how I found myself in a muscle car with a throbbing 5-litre V8 crawling through rush hour traffic. But riding a rodeo pony on to centre court at Wimbledon would make more sense. The clutch is so heavy it feels like I’m doing gym curls with my left calf, the gigantic engine jumps and snorts, and even the satnav seems confused. Then it starts to rain heavily. It feels like the car – and me – are a long way from home.</p> <p>But hold on one cotton-picking minute, this car is supposed to be a goddarn legend. There isn’t a fuel-sniffer on the planet who wouldn’t want to slip behind its wheel with that famous chromed logo galloping across it. There you can sit back and look over the double-brow dash, across the twin-ridged bonnet and out on to the grasslands of, um, Guildford.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d79115f84be23a12f9c9abc4127159b0725a2aec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d79115f84be23a12f9c9abc4127159b0725a2aec/7_0_3124_1875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the interior of the Mustang\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the interior of the Mustang with its classic flat dash. However it’s let down by the quality of some of the materials</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hit the starter and the giant engine burbles. But it’s quieter than you think, disappointingly so, despite offering a colossal 410bhp. In the UK you can wimp out and buy the car with a far a more sensible 2.3-litre EcoBoost. But, if you are the kind of person who wants a muscle car, you aren’t going to feel happy with anything less than the red-blooded V8. You wouldn’t want your stetson to go limp.</p> <p>With its shark-bite nose, heavily muscled shoulders and sculpted haunches, the new Mustang is certainly handsome, in a square-cut way. Little tweaks, such as the front wheel curtains and the tapered funnels at the back, all boost its aerodynamic appeal. Red is the colour most will go for, but the test vehicle I drove was banana yellow. This brought even more attention. People went crazy for it. Alongside the usual waves and thumbs-ups of passersby I even had one young fan stand to attention and salute me – at least I think that’s what he was doing. Another delight is the puddle light – a small LED on the underside of each wing-mirror which beams the silhouette of a wild horse on to the pavement. Also, the speedo has written across the top ‘Ground Speed’ as if this is actually a rocket that at any moment will head skywards.</p> <p>However all of this didn’t add up to a true bromance for me. There are bigger engines out there, but none that feel so over-commissioned for the work expected of them. I haven’t kangarooed a car so often since I was a learner. The car feels impossibly heavy at times, and even with the steering in comfort mode, a three-point turn was to be avoided. I can’t remember the last time I chose to walk to the shops rather than drive. On longer runs it came into its own, but do you want a car that’s a struggle the moment there’s any congestion?</p> <p>The interior appears shockingly cheap. The plastics used are so brittle you feel they might have been made of takeaway containers. I couldn’t get comfortable in the driving seat, despite a week of faffing with the settings. The back seats are a joke. The boot is unexpectedly large, but the liner is so flimsy you’d be worried even carry-on baggage would crack it. The satnav is Paleo it’s so outdated and tricky to use. It was all quite disheartening.</p> <p>But perhaps the biggest surprise of all is the price: the Mustang starts at £31,745. I asked dozens of neighbours how much they thought the car cost and the lowest offer I got was 40 grand. If only they’d spent more time getting to know the car, they might have lowered their estimate.</p> <p>Hey ho, they always say you should never meet your heroes…</p> <h2>Better by design</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7366a1d6aeb79b100faa7e4662f4233801323e51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7366a1d6aeb79b100faa7e4662f4233801323e51/0_0_1417_554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"That was then: the 2017 Ford Mustang compared to the outgoing model.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"391\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">That was then: the 2017 Ford Mustang compared to the outgoing model.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Herriott</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was recently contacted by Richard Herriott, assistant professor of Industrial Design at the Design School at Kolding in Denmark, who was puzzled by my lack of ‘design literacy’ when discussing new cars. I mentioned to him I was driving the new Mustang and he kindly agreed to cast his expert eye over it. This is what he had to say:</p> <p>The overall change is that Ford have accentuated the horizontal character of the vehicle. While the old car looked more brutal and Aston Martin-esque, the new one has smoother blends, and the two features that interrupted the front-to-rear flow are gone: the heavy B-pillar and the J-shaped scallop. At the front the lamps are slimmer and wrap around to the sides, again stressing horizontality and width. I think the previous car looked more masculine and robust. The new one loses some of that in the name of flow. In a sense there is not much you can do with a re-design if you have to maintain generation to generation visual continuity. The main elements are retained, but all adjusted within limits. The same kind of thing has happened with the Audi TT and the Golf. The Mustang isn’t only about a package and a certain type of performance. The customers also want the look. And the catch with this is that signalling change can be difficult. Too much and the customers go away, and if the look is the same the critics criticise the conservatism. </p> <p>Well, I couldn’t have said it better… Thanks Prof!</p> <p><em>Email Martin at </em><a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\"><em>martin.love@observer.co.uk</em></a><em> or follow him on Twitter </em><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinLove166\">@MartinLove166</a></em></p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Is there a truly secure messaging app? One could spend hours examining all the encrypted communications tools available, from popular services such as WhatsApp and Facebook’s Messenger to newcomers such as Signal and Wire. But while experts agree that some of these options are more secure than others, there always seems to be another flaw waiting to be discovered. This makes the search for a perfect app resemble the hunt for the goose that laid the golden egg.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-backdoor-allows-snooping-on-encrypted-messages\">WhatsApp vulnerability allows snooping on encrypted messages</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That point <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-backdoor-allows-snooping-on-encrypted-messages\">was driven home on Friday</a> with the revelation that attackers could exploit a security vulnerability in WhatsApp to snoop on its users. The vulnerability was found in the service’s implementation of end-to-end encryption, which is supposed to make it all but impossible for messages to be read by anyone except their intended recipient, and in WhatsApp’s management of the unique security keys used to scramble and unscramble those messages on users’ devices.</p> <p>The problem stemmed from WhatsApp’s ability to create new encryption keys for offline users. This is common for secure communication tools, but WhatsApp is set apart by its decision to re-encrypt messages with the new keys without informing their sender or recipient. </p> <p>This could allow someone to intercept communications with no indication to anyone involved with the conversation. WhatsApp has therefore effectively undermined the basic principle of end-to-end encryption.</p> <p>It would be easy to overreact to this issue. WhatsApp did not create a backdoor into its service – a claim with which Brian Acton, the company’s co-founder, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5nq201/whatsapp_backdoor_allows_snooping_on_encrypted/dce86wa/\">publicly took issue</a> on Friday, saying WhatsApp would “fight any government request” to create one.</p> <p>Nor did it introduce a vulnerability so critical that people should remove the app from their devices. Concerned users can verify someone’s identity by comparing the “fingerprints” associated with their key, and they can enable a setting that notifies them when a message has been re-encrypted with a new key.</p> <p>Yet even the nature of those notifications is up to question. There are two options, blocking or non-blocking, which refer to requiring users to manually verify that a new key is legitimate or simply notifying them when a key has been changed. WhatsApp notifications are non-blocking. Signal, the encrypted messaging tool from Open Whisper Systems (OWS) <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/05/whatsapp-rolls-out-full-encryption-to-a-billion-messenger-users\">whose end-to-end encryption protocol</a> is used in WhatsApp, Messenger and other apps, uses blocking notifications.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/13/the-guardian-view-on-internet-privacy-technology-cant-fix-it\">The Guardian view on internet privacy: technology can’t fix it | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moxie Marlinspike of OWS said Signal planned to make blocking notifications an option for some users and use non-blocking notifications by default. </p> <p>“The feedback we’ve gotten is that most of our users don’t want these messages to be blocking,” he said. “What they want is just to have the ability to verify the integrity of their communication and to see when these things are happening, but they don’t want it to interrupt their ordinary workflow.”</p> <p>Which brings the conversation back to the root of the problem: should messaging apps prioritize convenience or security? </p> <p>“It really depends on the service provider and the risk it wants to take,” said Alan Duric, chief technology officer at the Wire secure communications provider. </p> <p>“It is relatively difficult for WhatsApp to put it as ‘blocking’ when it has a billion users. And by doing it [the way WhatsApp has done it] you have a trade-off with the user experience and sacrificing something on security.” </p> <p>Wire takes the opposite approach by valuing security over convenience.</p> <p>Some messaging apps follow WhatsApp in not informing users of key changes by default. Others, like Wire, don’t send messages to people with new keys without user consent. These companies will face criticism no matter what they choose – WhatsApp users might worry that their messages are insecure; Wire users might grow tired of security notifications – and might change their approach based on user feedback as OWS is doing with the Signal app.</p> <p>There is no right or wrong answer. The same can be said for other decisions, such as Google’s Allo and Facebook Messenger’s “secret conversations” not using end-to-end encryption by default, which the companies say allows them to offer features that wouldn’t be possible otherwise. Apps that do use encryption by default – such as Signal and Wire, among others – require people to convince everyone with whom they wish to communicate to switch to unfamiliar messaging tools.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-encryption-backdoor-snooping-signal\">Should I be worried about the WhatsApp encryption vulnerability?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which is why these companies have different approaches to the same problem. WhatsApp has to decide between making 1 billion people more secure in non-obtrusive ways or notifying them every time a security key has changed. Google must balance efforts to make people more secure with the desire to offer features that could help a newcomer like Allo compete with established services. Even more privacy conscious apps like Signal have to design with their users in mind.</p> <p>There will never be a one-size-fits-all in the secure communications market. Just as these services have to decide on what problems they wish to solve, consumers must choose the app that best suits their needs. More apps support end-to-end encryption than ever, and even if none of them are perfect, this means private communications are more secure than before. These are nuanced problems that must be considered with care instead of being oversimplified.</p> <p>“WhatsApp has designed a pretty good thing with really considerable care and has successfully deployed it to the largest network of end-to-end encryption in the history of the world,” Marlinspike said. </p> <p>“Approaching questions of the best user experience and how we should think about these problems by just calling this a ‘backdoor’ and telling everyone to uninstall WhatsApp does a lot more harm than good, because it’s just going to drive people to other apps that use way less consideration and care that users are also not capable of evaluating the goodness of.”</p> <p>Don’t kill the goose for laying a bunch of silver eggs, just because people would have preferred gold.</p>',\n",

I\\xa0don’t know whether it was the alarm going off in my head, screaming “£200,000”, or the bright yellow brakes visible through the wheels, ramming home how much sheer metal work it takes to stop a machine such as this, once it gets moving. Perhaps it was because it arrived not with a driver so much as a minder and I felt the obscure urge to reassure him, as if I’d taken possession of an evacuee.</p> <p>Immediately, basic skills like observation and decision-making were shot: from the inside, I\\xa0couldn’t figure out how to open the door, only the window. In a\\xa0perverse bid to protect the roof from my own fingernails, I opened the fold-down roof to take my jumper off (this takes 14 seconds and is like watching an acrobat climb into a\\xa0tiny box). I was never not surprised by the roar of the ignition, nor anything but astonished by the acceleration. As the fresh acts of folly piled up, I couldn’t even reassure myself that nobody was watching; in a Ferrari, someone is always watching. The cliche is that it makes you feel like a film star, which is true. That film star was Mr Bean.</p> <p>Pointless to describe the exterior, except in terms of its effect on people; one guy knocked on the window to tell me the boot was open, when it wasn’t, just so he could have a go opening it and closing it again.</p> <p>Drive it, especially fast, on a\\xa0country road with undulation, corners, scenery and tractors, and you will understand the drooling. This car is so responsive, it feels like it’s reading your mind. It is somewhere between having an aeroplane and a superpower.</p> <p>Naturally, there are downsides. Emissions have come down by almost half, but that is because, previously, they were 450g/km, which makes it more like having an aeroplane. I have driven from London to the Isle of Wight in every car, from a Polo to a Transit van, and until now, never had to fill up on the way back. It is madly extravagant, the parking alarms are histrionic, and the binnacles so fancy that I was hypnotised by the yellow fascia and 80s font and not watching the road at all. The question is almost never, “Would you buy a Ferrari?”, but “Could it steal your heart?” I am not young enough to love a car for its roaring, nor old enough to dote on one for anything.

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Some are calling it Nintendo’s last chance. At least at manufacturing a games console. The creator of smash-hit machines since the original Nintendo Entertainment System in 1983 suffered an ignoble commercial failure with Wii U. Announced last year and revealed in full on Friday, the new Nintendo Switch machine has a lot to prove.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/why-i-am-confident-enough-to-pre-order-a-nintendo-switch\">Why I am confident enough to pre-order a Nintendo Switch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s a typically idiosyncratic creation. Described as a hybrid system, it works as a traditional home console, plugging into your TV, but it can also be slid out of its dock and played on the go, via a built in screen. The concept is fascinating, merging the portable and home experiences into one product, but what about the practice?</p> <p>On Friday afternoon, Nintendo held hands-on events in several cities around the world. Outside the Hammersmith Apollo in London, a long queue of lucky fans, media types and industry insiders waited patiently, many bleary-eyed from having stayed up until 4am watching Nintendo’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/nintendo-unveils-long-awaited-switch-game-console\">Switch console livestream from Tokyo</a>. All were eager to get inside, away from the cold and towards Nintendo’s future. Here’s what we discovered.</p> <h2>Hands-on with the machine</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb744c1781cf126c6e23760d2d9a89c36436f7aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb744c1781cf126c6e23760d2d9a89c36436f7aa/0_153_4284_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Nintendo Switch games console\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nintendo Switch games console.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Immediate first impressions. It’s small. The central tablet-shaped unit is smaller than a Wii U GamePad and has the same size screen - 6.2 inches, which is smaller than an iPad Mini. The dock through which you connect the device to your television is just a little bulkier. The Joy-Con controllers, which can be connected to the sides of the Switch to turn it into a handheld console, are tiny. Wrap your fingers around them, perhaps for a motion-controlled game of boxing, and they almost feel like they could disappear. You might want to actually wear your wrist strap for these, and don’t let your children run off with them or you’ll never find them again.</p> <p>Still, with their curved edges and soft finish the Joy-Con are surprisingly comfortable in every possible configuration. The grip that turns a pair of Joy-Con into something that resembles a standard controller might look a bit silly - and canine - but it nestles snugly in the hand. It was difficult, however, to get a proper feel for the weight of both the grip and the handheld mode with Joy-Con attached to either side of the screen, because they were all attached to their stands with thick security cables.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e025e667d7b8f6ec39d33b4ae2dc4b51dcd6c5a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e025e667d7b8f6ec39d33b4ae2dc4b51dcd6c5a9/0_59_2550_1531/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch in its box\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nintendo Switch in its box.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because of the security measures, it wasn’t possible to try much of the actual switching that gives the console its name, with one exception. When playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, attendees could switch from television to handheld mode by removing the Switch from its dock, which proved to be almost instant, and back again, which took a second longer. Placing the Switch in its dock didn’t seem to quite have the satisfactory click expected, but that might again be blamed on the thick cable throwing off the balance.</p> <p>Attendees weren’t allowed to try attaching the Joy-Con to the grip or the Switch itself, but the different games around the room were set up to be played in different ways. In handheld mode, games were displayed at 60fps and 720p, which looks pretty good on a screen that small. Some games were set up with the Switch as the display and the controllers detached, and for those it was common to see players leaning in to see more closely. It works, but is best saved for when you can’t use a television.</p> <p>Importantly, while it wasn’t usually possible to test physical switching from one mode to another, moving between games set up to be played in different ways felt natural. Those with experience with the likes of analog sticks and triggers should have no problems adapting to the feel of the different control methods. <br /></p> <h2>Hands-on with the games</h2> <p>Here are the titles we got a chance to play.</p> <p><strong>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"082cc7dabe47be8e475288e555434d03a12863d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/082cc7dabe47be8e475288e555434d03a12863d5/0_0_1799_1080/1000.png\" alt=\"Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given the popularity of this long-running adventure series, it’s unsurprising that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was the only game with a substantial queue. Many of the attendees had already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/16/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-hands-on-preview\">played this demo at E3</a>, but on a Wii U. The Switch version is largely similar, right down to the existence of Link’s Sheikah Slate, which was obviously meant to reflect the second-screen experience provided by the Wii U GamePad – an experience you can’t have on Switch because when it’s docked, the screen is not visible. You can of course undock your Switch and explore that beautiful world – 720p but still lovely – on the go, if only for up to three hours at a time.</p> <p><strong>1-2 Switch (Nintendo; launch title)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef79b0cbbebf4a939cfbf61b2bf8c173703e60aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef79b0cbbebf4a939cfbf61b2bf8c173703e60aa/106_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"1-2 Switch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">1-2 Switch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The game that best showed off what the Joy-Con can do was 1-2-Switch, a collection of mini games designed to get players looking away from the screen and at each other. Each mini game on show was one-on-one competitive multiplayer, each player using a single Joy-Con to perform some action mimicking real life.</p> <p>Quick Draw and Samurai Training use the accelerometer and gyro-sensors inside the controllers to test your reaction times, by respectively asking you to shoot your opponent or catch the sword they swing through your open hands. The latter also demonstrates the sturdiness of the Joy-Con, since you catch the sword by clapping the controller in your hand.</p> <p>Ball Count and Safe Crack demonstrate the “HD rumble” technology in the devices that can make it feel like there are little balls rolling around inside the controller. Nintendo claimed that the rumble tech is so intricate it can even make the Joy-Con feel like a tumbler full of ice cubes. It’s cool, but unlikely to be used to its full extent in many games.</p> <p>But the 1-2-Switch mini game everyone was talking about was <a href=\"https://youtu.be/cIdmsFjsvdo\">Milk</a>, for which you hold the Joy-Con vertically, wrap your fingers around it, and move it up and down while applying rhythmic pressure to the top and bottom in turn. You know, to milk a cow. In the background, the screen shows a stylised view of a cow’s teats delivering the ... product. Unsurprisingly, footage has already been a hit on social media.</p> <p>These mini games are great the first time you try them, and would probably go down well at parties, just like the original Wii games did a decade ago, but the collection lacks the lasting appeal required to justify a purchase. It’s a shame Nintendo hasn’t chosen to bundle it in with the console, especially given the popularity of Wii Sports.</p> <p><strong>Snipperclips (Nintendo; March 2017)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a0c4fa27a6ec93f45e143241e22dd16cc3cbc00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a0c4fa27a6ec93f45e143241e22dd16cc3cbc00/106_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Snipperclips\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Snipperclips.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another game that caused a lot of buzz on the showroom floor was a cooperative 2D puzzle game that involves two shapes with feet and faces cutting chunks out of each other in order to create new shapes and solve challenges. Played in pairs with a Joy-Con each, Snipperclips fits well with the tendency players have to lean in when using the Switch on its kickstand as the display. Its unique mechanic feels very refreshing, and appropriate for a Nintendo console, but Snipperclips might not be as new as it seems. A very similar game called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJGooKIoy1Q\">Friendshapes</a>, from brothers Tom and Adam of SFB Games, was playable at EGX’s Leftfield Collection back in 2015.</p> <p><strong>Arms (Nintendo; March 2017)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ed8b724e8327d3173897714d3c429fbdf5599ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ed8b724e8327d3173897714d3c429fbdf5599ab/96_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arms\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arms is reminiscent of the boxing game in Wii Sports, albeit with characters whose arms extend on springs and end in a variety of weapons. Hold two Joy-Con vertically and turned so that the buttons face inwards – which is still comfortable but makes you grateful for the wrist strap – and punch. You can also tilt the controllers to move, turn them inwards to shield, punch both at once to grab, press L and R to dash and jump, and press ZL or ZR to use a character’s special move - heal while shielding, hover, teleport and so on. There’s plenty of strategy here, but just as boxing was the lesser played of the Wii Sports games because it required each player to have a nunchuck, Arms is likely to suffer from its need for two Joy-Con each, especially given their listed price of £75 a pair.</p> <p><strong>Splatoon 2 (Nintendo; summer 2017)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b255631e460c1f2d133b62cb94a33ff49876561a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b255631e460c1f2d133b62cb94a33ff49876561a/40_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Splatoon 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Splatoon 2.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite promises of a full sequel, Splatoon 2 feels very similar to the original, which will probably be just fine for those who racked up dozens or hundreds of hours and just want more of the same, or those who skipped the Wii U altogether and will experience it for the first time on Switch. The demo did include one new weapon, Splat Dualies, which let your squid shoot their coloured ink from both hands at once. Using motion controls – in this case in handheld mode – still feels gimmicky, fun at first but not ideal for fast-paced competitive play.</p> <p><strong>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (Nintendo; 28 April)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fa1acfc330d01a6972684ff89f72206a6d1b891\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fa1acfc330d01a6972684ff89f72206a6d1b891/80_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe isn’t pretending to be anything more than an upgraded version of Mario Kart 8, which will suit both those who want to bring that experience with them when they upgrade from Wii U to Switch, and those who’ve never played the game before. Changes include the introduction of a battle mode, some new characters including ones from Splatoon, and an optional smart steering feature that keeps players on the track.</p> <p>But the biggest Switch-specific feature, of course, is the ability to play in many different ways. At the event, attendees could play eight-player local multiplayer in handheld mode, with the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller in television mode, or with the Switch on its kickstand and two players each using one Joy-Con in a tiny steering wheel. Any way you play it, Mario Kart 8 is still great.</p> <p><strong>Fast RMX </strong><strong>(Shin’en; March 2017)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4d50d8781a410dd5f81c05c831bfd01b21f6d39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4d50d8781a410dd5f81c05c831bfd01b21f6d39/121_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fast RMX\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fast RMX.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This colourful futuristic racer looked great in 1080p and 60fps on the television mode, but it would have been good to test out how it plays in handheld mode, whether you can still play two-player splitscreen and if that causes the frame-rate to drop. Still, with little more to worry about than staying on the track and switching your anti-gravity vehicle’s colour in time to catch boost strips, Fast RMX is good simple fun.</p> <p><strong>And the rest</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c7582912095755c9951c1d879dffdc2678d9068\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c7582912095755c9951c1d879dffdc2678d9068/19_0_800_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sonic Mania\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sonic Mania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sega</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Sonic Mania</strong> (Sega; Spring 2017) was described as a homage to Sonic. It’s neither a new game nor strictly a reboot. The demo was the first level of the original Sonic but with added Tails and dash ability, and a different boss encounter at the end.</p> <p><strong>Skylanders Imaginators</strong> (Toys for Bob; Activision; 3 March) was demonstrated the NFC, with players bringing Skylanders into the game by tapping them against the right Joy-Con. It works well, but feels less magical than placing them on a solid pedestal.</p> <p><strong>Super Bomberman R</strong> (Konami; 3 March) was also played with two players with a Joy-Con each, leaning into the Switch on its kickstand. This setup seems to work well for retro-type games, and we’ll probably see more come to Switch.<br /></p> <p><strong>Just Dance 2017</strong> (Ubisoft; 3 March) also worked well with each player holding just one Joy-Con, their small size and light weight an advantage for those who want to forget they’re holding a controller at all.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddefe0b2720496a3fa361073579fc518f0de2e38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddefe0b2720496a3fa361073579fc518f0de2e38/0_256_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Attendees at the Nintendo Switch launch event\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Nintendo Switch launch event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Our verdict</h2> <p>As its name suggests, the main selling point of the Switch is the ability to play it in all sorts of different configurations. Though it was disappointing not to be allowed to try many of these actions at the event, most of the configurations were available and proved viable even if they sacrificed some resolution or power or – in the case of leaning in to better see the Switch on its kickstand – comfort. The question is whether people will see these options as reason enough to buy.</p> <p>If we’re going to question the necessity of certain features, when will we see why the Switch needed a capacitive touch screen? What games will make the HD rumble worth whatever extra cost it added to the expensive Joy-Con controllers? Without having 1-2-Switch bundled in with every console, will players care about the motion controls and will developers bother to create more games that use them? Will there be enough online content to justify paying a monthly subscription after the free introductory period ends?</p> <p>Of course, you could just see these features as a bonus to a console that looks and feels great, but then the selling point has to be the games. As far as launch titles go the Switch is lacking, but then the hardcore fans who’ll buy the console on day one will likely be satisfied with just the huge open-world Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. And for those who wait for Christmas there’ll be lots more to choose from, supposedly including a new open-world Mario game in Super Mario Odyssey.</p> <p>As for third-party developers, word on the show floor was that the Switch is far easier to develop for than the Wii U, which could translate to better third-party support. Given the architecture is apparently similar to the latest Sony and Microsoft machines, it should at least be easier for developers to port across their PS4 and Xbox One games to bulk out the Switch library. Whether they do this or not will depend on whether the console shows signs of success. Low initial sales can quickly cause a vicious cycle in which publishers withdraw support and further lower a console’s chances. </p> <p>This was a fun event, filled with familiar Nintendo experiences, but doubts remain. Given what happened with the Wii U, here’s hoping Nintendo can switch things up.</p>',\n",

But the spokeswoman ruled out such an attack on Friday night.<br /></p> <p>The trust has not said how much of its system has been affected by the attack or whether patient data has been compromised but it said it believed that most of the affected system was housing corporate data. </p> <p>The trust’s filing system between departments has been turned off while the investigation takes place.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Staff at the Royal Free London foundation trust were also warned to beware of attacks on Friday, the Guardian has learned.<br /></p> <p>“We have been informed of a major cyber-attack on NHS organisations. Please exercise extreme caution when opening any email attachments from unknown source or that don’t seem relevant to you. We will be carrying out security scans on all computers within the trust so please leave them switched on until further notice,” wrote the trust’s IT director, Tosh Mondal.</p> <p>A spokesman said the email was in reaction to the Barts attack and that the Royal Free London, as well as Barnet and Chase Farm hospitals, had not been affected.</p> <p>NHS Digital said it was aware that Barts had been infected by a “virus which has affected their IT systems”.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: “This issue highlights the fact that there are threats to data security within the health and care sector, as with any other sector. We remain committed to supporting the protection of data with the highest possible security standards, high levels of security expertise from the centre and appropriate training and awareness of the risks for all staff.”</p> <p>She declined to answer questions about whether other NHS trusts had been affected, how much data may have been affected and who may be behind the attack.</p> <p>In October, the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole foundation trust was hit by an attack in which malware was used to encrypt files and demand a ransom in order to restore access. The trust did not pay the ransom but was forced to cancel patient appointments as its systems were shut down to remove the virus.</p> <p>John Bambenek, a threat intelligence manager at the firm Fidelis Cybersecurity, said: “The trouble is that local authorities and governments aren’t very prepared and they have extremely valuable information that simply can’t be lost, so they’re a tempting target for cybercriminals. </p> <p>“Cyber defence is essential, but it’s no longer enough; organisations of all sizes need to invest in detecting threats as well. Only then will cyber criminals be caught early enough to expel them from the network before serious damage is done.”</p>',\n",

But new research shows that in fact the company could read messages, owing to the way WhatsApp has implemented its end-to-end encryption protocol.</p> <p> “It’s just another threat to the security of activists,” said Zaina Erhaim, a Syrian journalist and campaigner, who said she did not herself use the app much but knew of other Syrians who did.</p> <p>Many of Syria’s boldest activists have learned to be wary of any communications system promising digital protections, because of the widespread use of torture by both the government of Bashar al-Assad and opponents including Isis. That can make it impossible for any activist who is seized to keep their secrets. “When captured, they are forced to decrypt their files,” Erhaim said.</p> <p>The flaw could be most dangerous to people sharing sensitive information who are not particularly tech savvy or had been lulled into a false sense of security by WhatsApp’s reputation for secure encryption.</p> <p>“There could be some fears,” said a medical aid worker, who said the app was popular with his colleagues although they did not use it for the most sensitive conversations. “I think people use it for privacy and convenience.”</p> <p>If news of the security flaw pushes dissidents and others away from WhatsApp, it will not be the first time that a once-trusted programme has been sidelined. A decade ago Skype was the communication method of choice, but confidence in its systems was already failing badly before leaks by Edward Snowden revealed that the US government was regularly <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data\">listening in on calls</a>.</p> <p>Other systems that have maintained a reputation for security have become victims of their own encryption success, banned by the authorities they were being used against. At the end of last year Egypt <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/signal-claims-egypt-is-blocking-access-to-encrypted-messaging-app\">blocked access to Open Whisper Systems’ Signal app</a>, a rival to WhatsApp that was recommended by Snowden.</p> <p>It uses the same protocol as WhatsApp but does not suffer from the same vulnerability. It was favoured by some dissidents because its settings allow for the automatic deletion of new messages.</p> <p>WhatsApp, by contrast, stores messages by default, making a user potentially more vulnerable if they are detained.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>When I went to bed on Thursday night, I knew I would be pre-ordering a Nintendo Switch as soon as I woke on Friday.</p> <p>I had some rules for myself, of course. The price had to be right; there had to be at least one game I wanted coming on launch day, plus at least one other shortly after; and the implicit promises made in the first announcement – that it would be a truly hybrid system, as capable on-the-go as docked – had to be kept.</p> <p>But why did I even consider pre-ordering? After all, committing to a console sight unseen is generally considered a bit silly. You could end up with a big block of plastic sat under your TV for a decade, slowly gathering dust. I know the feeling of looking sadly at an unused gaming gadget: I bought a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/feb/21/playstation-vita-review\">PS Vita</a>.</p> <p>But from the first footage Nintendo showed of the Switch, it was clear that I was their target demographic made flesh. That’s not just a function of the bearded hipster types the company used to show off the hardware: it’s also because the Switch seemed to suggest a reappraisal of sorts for Nintendo, accepting its position as a secondary console for those with one foot in the gaming market already and offering an element of flexibility for people whose lives don’t revolve around video games.</p> <p>I’m not a natural Nintendo customer. I don’t own a Wii U or a 3DS, and though my heart yearns for a bit more Pokémon in my life, I never really considered getting either of them. I already don’t have enough time to play every game I want to on my PS4, and the presence of an iPhone, iPad and the aforementioned dust-gathering Vita in my life meant I was loath to pick up a second portable console.</p> <p>The Switch managed to convince me it would be neither of those. Its portability gave it a reason to be in my life despite the fact that I already have a PS4, while the fact that it’s a fully-fledged console made me more confident it won’t sit gathering dust except on long trips overseas.</p> <p>Waking up on Friday morning, my resolve was simultaneously attacked and strengthened. The British price for the Switch, at £279.99, is £30 more than I’d expected and £80 more than I’d hoped. There’s not even an unfair exchange rate: pre-tax, the price is £233, or $285. In the US, the pretax cost of the Switch is $300. Thanks, Brexit.</p> <p>Other aspects of the announcement were a mixed bag. Generally, learning about new features of a console should only be a good thing, and the Switch has a lot of previously unannounced features, from the gyroscopes and IR cameras in the “Joy-Cons” to the presence of a fully-fledged online service. But Nintendo’s history makes those features as potentially concerning as they are welcoming: I’m not looking forward to reliving the dog days of the Wii with a rash of unnecessary motion controls, and I’m certainly not confident enough in Nintendo’s online chops to pay them money for the privilege of struggling to play games with my friends.</p> <p>So why did I pull out my credit card anyway? It’s all about the games.</p> <p>The launch title is there. I have no doubt that my Switch will spend a few months as the Zelda: Breath of the Wild machine, and I’m OK with that fact. That’s good, because the non-Zelda titles are … slim. Only one other first-party title will be on the shelves, the motion controlled party game 1-2 Switch; it’s the sort of thing I’d be overjoyed to receive as a box-in title, along the lines of Wii Sports or Playroom VR, but for $49.99, I think I’ll just buy a board game.</p> <p>More importantly, the future line up suggests I’ll be using the system for some time. A lot of ports from Wii U fill the short term comfortably, while future titles including XenoBlade 2, Splatoon 2 and a beautiful, untitled, Square Enix RPG rounding out the foreseeable future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/819767096510803968\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Square Enix presents a brand new RPG from the Bravely Default team, coming to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash\">#NintendoSwitch</a>! <a href=\"https://t.co/LncFNIwpXG\">pic.twitter.com/LncFNIwpXG</a></p>&mdash; Nintendo UK (@NintendoUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/819767096510803968\">January 13, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Then there’s Super Mario Odyssey, the first major Mario platformer since 2010’s Super Mario Galaxy 2 for the Wii. For me, the game is full of red flags: everything from the “open-world”, “sandbox” gameplay to the bizarre placing of Mario alongside realistically proportioned humans in “New Donk City” to Mario’s impeccably rendered hair.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Babylonian/status/819802882211909633\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">i&#39;m gonna start a change.o\\u180erg petition begging Nintendo to make the hair in Super Mario Odyssey less realistic <a href=\"https://t.co/qAzC8mv5eL\">pic.twitter.com/qAzC8mv5eL</a></p>&mdash; Nick Robinson (@Babylonian) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Babylonian/status/819802882211909633\">January 13, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Those don’t mean the game will be bad, of course, but they tend to be fairly highly correlated with things I’m not overly eager to see. Weird 2006 Sonic game where he falls in love with a human woman, I’m looking your way.</p> <p>At the same time, there hasn’t really ever been a bad game in that thread. Mario 64 revolutionised the genre, and its follow-ups Sunshine and the pair of Galaxies were all stellar platforms in their own right.</p> <p>In six weeks, I’ll find out whether or not I was overly optimistic. I’ll be £280 down, plus the cost of the new Zelda. Plus, probably the cost of a second pair of Joy-Cons. Still, one final upside: the Switch charges with a USB-C cable, which means my MacBook Pro powerbrick is all I need to take on holiday with me. Two ill-advised, probably over-priced purchases cancel each other out! So that’s all good then.</p>',\n",

This is not an easy task: plenty of generals fought hard to fight racial desegregation and to limit the role of women in combat. </p> <p>Yet the US military was desegregated in 1948, six years before Brown v Board of Education forced desegregation of schools. And the supreme court ruled that LGBT individuals could openly serve in the military before they could legally marry.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Private companies focus on \\'culture fit\\', emphasize teams that get along, which reinforces existing segregation patterns</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Morale is often proposed as the main reason soldiers should not be forced to entrust their lives to people who are different from them. Yet time and again, this justification collapses under broader interests to grow the military. </p> <p>As a result, commanders are forced to find ways to build up morale across difference, to actively seek to break down barriers to teamwork, and to help a group of people whose demographics, values, politics and ideologies are as varied as the country’s jell. In the process, they build one of the most crucial social infrastructures of the country. They build the diverse social fabric that underpins democracy.</p> <p>Tons of money was poured into defense after 9/11, but the number of people serving in the US military today is far lower than it was throughout the 1980s. Why? </p> <p>Starting in the 1990s and accelerating after 9/11, the US privatized huge chunks of the military. This means that private contractors and their employees play critical roles in everything, from providing food services to equipment maintenance to military housing. </p> <p>The impact of this on the role of the military in society is significant. For example, it undermines recruits’ ability to get training to develop critical skills that will be essential in civilian life. Instead, while serving on active duty, they spend much more time on the frontlines and in high-risk battle, increasing the likelihood that they will be physically or psychologically harmed. The impact on skills development and job opportunities is tremendous, but so is the impact on the diversification of the social fabric.</p> <p>Private vendors are not engaged in the same social engineering project as the military and, as a result, tend to hire and fire people based on their ability to work effectively as a team. Like many companies, they have little incentive to invest in helping diverse teams learn to work together as effectively as possible. Building diverse teams – especially ones in which members depend on each other for their survival – is extremely hard, time-consuming, and emotionally exhausting. As a result, private companies focus on “culture fit”, emphasize teams that get along, and look for people who already have the necessary skills, all of which helps reinforce existing segregation patterns.</p> <p>The result is that, in the last 20 years, we’ve watched one of our major structures for diversification collapse without anyone taking notice. And because of how it’s happened, the process is also connected to job opportunities and economic opportunity for many working- and middle-class individuals, seeding resentment and hatred.</p> <h2><strong>A self-segregated college life</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b442ab0e4ad77fc405b1c1a3525b4f0ab690fe44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b442ab0e4ad77fc405b1c1a3525b4f0ab690fe44/0_206_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Muslim female students at University of Houston, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘At many universities, residential life is often in the business of student therapy.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you ask a college admissions officer at an elite institution to describe how they build a class of incoming freshmen, you will quickly realize that the American college system is a diversification project. </p> <p>Unlike colleges in most parts of the world, the vast majority of freshmen at top-tier universities in the US live on campus with roommates who are assigned to them. Colleges approach housing assignments as an opportunity to pair diverse strangers with one another to build social ties. This makes sense given how many friendships emerge out of freshman dorms. By pairing middle-class kids with students from wealthier families, elite institutions help diversify the elites of the future.</p> <p>This diversification project produces a tremendous amount of conflict. Although plenty of people adore their college roommates and relish the opportunity to get to know people from different walks of life as part of their college experience, there is an amazing amount of angst about dorm assignments and the troubles that brew once folks try to live together in close quarters. At many universities, residential life is often in the business of student therapy as students complain about their roommates and dorm-mates. </p> <p>Yet just like in the military, learning how to negotiate conflict and diversity in close quarters can be tremendously effective in weaving the social fabric.</p> <p>In the spring of 2006, I was doing fieldwork with teenagers at a time when they had just received acceptances to college. I giggled at how many of them immediately wrote to the college in which they intended to enroll, begging for a campus email address so that they could join Facebook through the school (before Facebook was broadly available). In the previous year, I had watched the previous class look up roommate assignments on MySpace so I was prepared for the fact that they’d use Facebook to do the same. What I wasn’t prepared for was how quickly they would all get on Facebook, map the incoming freshman class, and use this information to ask for a roommate switch. </p> <p>Before they even arrived on campus in August or September, they had self-segregated as much as possible.</p> <p>A few years later, I watched another trend hit: cellphones. While these were touted as tools that allowed students to stay connected to parents (which prompted many faculty to complain about “helicopter parents” arriving on campus), they really ended up serving as a crutch to address homesickness, as incoming students focused on maintaining ties to high school friends rather than building new relationships.</p> <p>Students go to elite universities to “get an education”. Few realize that the true quality product that elite colleges in the US have historically offered is social network diversification. Even when it comes to job acquisition, <a href=\"https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/the_strength_of_weak_ties_and_exch_w-gans.pdf\">sociologists have long known</a> that diverse social networks (“weak ties”) are what increase job prospects. By self-segregating on campus, students undermine their own potential while also helping fragment the diversity of the broader social fabric.</p> <h2><strong>Diversity is hard</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0562f0fd2ab907324023c040ece1241379768340\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0562f0fd2ab907324023c040ece1241379768340/0_184_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Increasingly, the technologies and tools around us allow us to self-segregate with ease’.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Increasingly, the technologies and tools around us allow us to self-segregate with ease.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Diversity is often touted as highly desirable. Indeed, in professional contexts, we know that more diverse teams often outperform homogeneous teams. Diversity also increases cognitive development, both intellectually and socially. And yet actually encountering and working through diverse viewpoints, experiences, and perspectives is hard work. It’s uncomfortable. It’s emotionally exhausting. It can be downright frustrating.</p> <p>Thus, given the opportunity, people typically revert to situations where they can be in homogeneous environments. They look for “safe spaces” and “culture fit”. Systems that are “personalized” are highly desirable. Most people aren’t looking to self-segregate, but they do it anyway. </p> <p>Increasingly, the technologies and tools around us allow us to self-segregate with ease. Is your uncle annoying you with his political rants? Mute him. Tired of getting ads for irrelevant products? Reveal your preferences. Want your search engine to remember the things that matter to you? Let it capture data. Want to watch a TV show that appeals to your senses? Here are some recommendations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What makes people willing to hear difference is knowing and trusting people whose worldview differs from their own</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Any company whose business model is based on advertising revenue and attention is incentivized to engage you by giving you what you want. And what you want in theory is different than what you want in practice.</p> <p>Consider, for example, what Netflix encountered when it started its streaming offer. Users didn’t watch the movies that they had placed into their queue. Those movies were the movies they thought they wanted, movies that reflected their ideal selves – 12 Years a Slave, for example. What they watched when they could stream whatever they were in the mood for at that moment was the equivalent of junk food – reruns of Friends, for example. (This completely undid Netflix’s recommendation infrastructure, which had been trained on people’s idealistic self-images).</p> <p>The divisions are not just happening through commercialism, though. School choice has led people to self-segregate from childhood on up. The structures of American work life mean that fewer people work alongside others from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Our contemporary culture of retail and service labor means there’s a huge cultural gap between workers and customers with little opportunity to truly get to know one another. Even many religious institutions are increasingly fragmented such that people have fewer interactions across diverse lines. (Just think about how there are now “family services” and “traditional services” which segregate people by age.) </p> <p>In so many parts of public, civic and professional life, we are self-segregating, and the opportunities for doing so are increasing every day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/12/burst-your-bubble-five-conservative-articles-peak-trump-week\">Burst your bubble: five conservative articles to read in this \\'peak Trump\\' week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By and large, the American public wants to have strong connections across divisions. They see the value in it, politically and socially. But they’re not going to work for it. And given the option, they’re going to renew their license remotely, try to get out of jury duty, and use available data to seek out housing and schools that are filled with people like them. </p> <p>This is the conundrum we now face.</p> <p>Many pundits remarked that, during the 2016 election season, very few Americans were regularly exposed to people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/16/facebook-bias-bubble-us-election-conservative-liberal-news-feed\">whose political ideology conflicted with their own</a>. This is true. But it cannot be fixed by Facebook or the news media. Exposing people to content that challenges their perspective doesn’t actually make them more empathetic to those values and perspectives. To the contrary, it polarizes them. </p> <p>What makes people willing to hear difference is knowing and trusting people whose worldview differs from their own. Exposure to content cannot make up for self-segregation.</p> <p>If we want to develop a healthy democracy, we need a diverse and highly connected social fabric. This requires creating contexts in which the American public voluntarily struggles with the challenges of diversity to build bonds that will last a lifetime. </p> <p>We have been systematically undoing this, and the public has used new technological advances to make their lives easier by self-segregating. This has increased polarization, and we’re going to pay a heavy price. Rather than focusing on what media enterprises can and should do, we need to focus instead on building new infrastructures for connection where people have a reason to come together across divisions. We need that social infrastructure just as much as we need bridges and roads.</p>',\n",

It is used by over 1 billion people across the world including in countries with oppressive regimes. It was bought by Facebook in 2014 for $22bn (£18bn) and implemented end-to-end encryption in April 2016.</p> <h2>What is end-to-end encryption?</h2> <p>End-to-end encryption (E2EE) ensures that a conversation can only be read by the sender and recipient and not intercepted by a middleman. WhatsApp uses the acclaimed Signal encryption protocol that relies on the exchanging of unique security keys that are verified between users to guarantee communications cannot be intercepted by a middleman.</p> <p>Anything said between users with E2EE is guaranteed to be private during transit, unless there’s a backdoor to the encryption.</p> <h2> What is a backdoor?</h2> <p><br />A backdoor to a technology such as encryption is simply a way for a third-party to access something secure without the primary parties being aware. In this case, it is a vulnerability that could be used as a backdoor by a third-party such as WhatsApp to read encrypted messages that are supposedly secure against interception. Your security technology is only as strong as the weakest link. The introduction of a vulnerability able to be used as A backdoor is the weak link.</p> <h2>What has WhatsApp done?</h2> <p>The Signal encryption protocol has no known weaknesses if it is implemented correctly. Whatsapp’s implementation has a vulnerability that could be used as a backdoor into the Signal protocol, giving itself the ability to force the generation of new encryption keys for offline users and to make the sender re-encrypt messages with new keys and send them again for any messages that have not been marked as delivered.</p> <p>It means that it could generate keys known to Whatsapp or a third-party and therefore read and intercept apparently encrypted messages without the sender or recipients knowledge.</p> <h2>Why is it like it is?</h2> <p>WhatsApp says that it used this implementation of the Signal protocol to aid usability. If it is not in place, messages sent to an offline user, who then changes their smartphone or has to re-install whatsapp and in doing so generates new security keys for themselves, would remain undelivered once the user comes back online.</p> <p>A WhatsApp spokesperson told the Guardian: “In many parts of the world, people frequently change devices and Sim cards. In these situations, we want to make sure people’s messages are delivered, not lost in transit.”</p> <h2>Should I be worried?</h2> <p>Unlike most of Facebook’s other messaging and social media services, this vulnerability is unlikely to ever be used for profiling for advertising purposes. The burden to execute the interception of messages is likely too high to be cost effective.</p> <p>But the same cannot be said for government agencies and actors. A way into a supposedly secure, end-to-end encrypted, private messaging service could be a “goldmine” for surveillance purposes and is “a huge betrayal of user trust”, according to privacy advocates.</p> <p>The amount of private information sent knowingly or unknowingly through WhatsApp could be vast and therefore is a very attractive target for surveillance.</p> <h2>Should I stop using WhatsApp?</h2> <p>If you use WhatsApp as a way to avoid government surveillance due to its end-to-end encryption service, you should stop using it immediately.</p> <p>Facebook and WhatsApp could be compelled to give government agencies such as GCHQ and the US National Security Agency access to users’ messages.</p> <h2>What are the alternatives?</h2> <p>There are several alternatives to WhatsApp that use encryption to secure communications against interception. The most recommended is Signal, which was developed by <a href=\"https://whispersystems.org/\">Open Whisper Systems</a> and is the namesake of the Signal E2EE protocol.</p> <p>It is used and recommended by NSA whistle blower Edward Snowden, and is considered the gold standard for private messaging. It does not have the same vulnerability in its implementation of E2EE as WhatsApp, and is available for <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669\">iOS</a>.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 17 January to clarify earlier references to a “backdoor”.</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-backdoor-allows-snooping-on-encrypted-messages\"><strong>Exclusive</strong>: WhatsApp vulnerability allows snooping on encrypted messages</a></li> </ul>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Nintendo announced all the details of its Switch console on Friday morning, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/nintendo-unveils-long-awaited-switch-game-console\">revealing a 3 March launch date</a> and £280 price tag. But what about the games? Everyone was expecting a new Super Mario title and perhaps a remaster of ElderScrolls V: Skyrim – and those were certainly delivered. But what else has been confirmed?</p> <p>Here are the titles we’re most looking forward to. <br /></p> <h2><strong>Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f43eedfac6f92155cc00de2fa5d15f06186ea26b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f43eedfac6f92155cc00de2fa5d15f06186ea26b/275_92_1645_988/1000.png\" alt=\"Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now confirmed as a launch title, the latest adventure in the legendary series will see Link exploring a lushly detailed open-world version of Hyrule. A whole new range of weapons and a new survival feature, requiring players to forage for food in order to stay healthy, adding grit to the familiar Zelda experience.</p> <h2><strong>Splatoon 2</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ed1f91b2ea44b07b40178d3d5d2f84a569059ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ed1f91b2ea44b07b40178d3d5d2f84a569059ad/40_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Splatoon 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Splatoon 2</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We were fully expecting a version of Nintendo’s family friendly team-based shooter – but not a full sequel. Splatoon 2 adds new weapons and modes, plus a portable multiplayer option, allowing you to indulge in local eight-player battles wherever you are.</p> <h2><strong>Ultra Street Fighter 2: The Final Challengers</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6ef5c3e8f646eb182ac30102caf86c3c8762932\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6ef5c3e8f646eb182ac30102caf86c3c8762932/204_147_1206_724/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ultra Street Fighter II\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ultra Street Fighter II</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: capcom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The classic Street Fighter experience is returning with new characters (including the brilliantly named Evil Ryu and Violent Ken) and a choice of old-school pixel art graphics or a new modern look. There is also a unique control option for the Joy-Con pads, allowing seamless two-player action.</p> <h2><strong>Super Mario Odyssey</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2befcc2030dfe9dcbabf6277ed15016d460dc705\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2befcc2030dfe9dcbabf6277ed15016d460dc705/50_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Super Mario Odyssey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Super Mario Odyssey</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An all-new Super Mario adventure set in a vast sandbox world, with a huge array of scenic styles judging by the demo shown at Nintendo’s announcement livestream. Mario will also be able to throw his cap for a variety of uses. It’s rare that you get to use the phrase ‘interesting hat-throwing mechanic’ in a game preview.</p> <h2><strong>Super Bomberman R</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb8f4fef3b2cb862ca7535ed07b38718cdfcb621\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb8f4fef3b2cb862ca7535ed07b38718cdfcb621/61_0_1816_1090/1000.png\" alt=\"Super Bomberman R\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Super Bomberman R</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Konami</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At last, the brilliant Hudsonsoft maze blasting game is returning to a major console, courtesy of Konami. Up to eight players will be able to take part in local-multiplayer challenges. the only thing we’re worried about is the news that it’ll be 3D. Super Bomberman should always be 2D. Hopefully that’s an option.</p> <h2><strong> Xenoblade Chronicles 2</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c11b12c22f0a52f8759acd54770011f6f590bf37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c11b12c22f0a52f8759acd54770011f6f590bf37/64_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Xenoblade Chronicles 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The revered role-playing adventure series will come to Switch with an entirely new hero, on a journey to Elysium. Tetsuya Takahashi, the executive director on the original Xenoblade Chronicles, is guiding development, but little else is known beyond the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sJuiTw6nk7A\">teasing trailer</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Shin Megami Tensei – new title</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TkIX4W23mM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1TkIX4W23mM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Again, not much information is available about this new instalment in the post-apocalyptic role-playing series. We know from the trailer that it’s using the Unreal Engine 4 technology so it’ll look very different to Shin Megami Tensei 4: Apocalypse on the 3DS.</p> <h2><strong>New game from Bravely Default team</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/819767096510803968\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Square Enix presents a brand new RPG from the Bravely Default team, coming to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash\">#NintendoSwitch</a>! <a href=\"https://t.co/LncFNIwpXG\">pic.twitter.com/LncFNIwpXG</a></p>&mdash; Nintendo UK (@NintendoUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/819767096510803968\">January 13, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>All we have about this upcoming role-playing adventure is the tweet from Nintendo, but look at those lovely visuals – a sort of tilt-shift pixel art style, mixed with the sort of anime panache you’d expect from the team behind <a href=\"http://bravelydefault.nintendo.com/\">Bravely Default</a> on the 3DS. </p> <h2><strong>Minecraft</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/4JStudios/status/819824190001909760\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Minecraft: Switch Edition :)<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MinecraftSwitch?src=hash\">#MinecraftSwitch</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wcNaCiC18P\">pic.twitter.com/wcNaCiC18P</a></p>&mdash; 4J Studios (@4JStudios) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/4JStudios/status/819824190001909760\">January 13, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Once again, all we have is a tweet, this time from 4J Studios, the developer responsible for the console versions of the block-building game.

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>A security vulnerability that can be used to allow Facebook and others to intercept and read encrypted messages has been found within its WhatsApp messaging service.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Facebook claims that no one can intercept WhatsApp messages, not even the company and its staff, ensuring privacy for its billion-plus users. But new research shows that the company could in fact read messages due to the way WhatsApp has implemented its end-to-end encryption protocol.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-encryption-backdoor-snooping-signal\">Should I be worried about the WhatsApp encryption backdoor?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Privacy campaigners said the vulnerability is a “huge threat to freedom of speech” and warned it could be used by government agencies as a backdoor to snoop on users who believe their messages to be secure. </p> <p>WhatsApp has made <a href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/general/28030015\">privacy and security a primary selling point</a>, and has become a go to communications tool of <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/28/middleeast/whatsapp-syria-aleppo-activists/\">activists</a>, dissidents and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/04/why-do-diplomats-use-this-alien-whatsapp-emoji-for-vladimir-putin\">diplomats</a>.</p> <p>WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption relies on the generation of unique security keys, using the acclaimed Signal protocol, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/05/whatsapp-rolls-out-full-encryption-to-a-billion-messenger-users\">developed by Open Whisper Systems</a>, that are traded and verified between users to guarantee communications are secure and cannot be intercepted by a middleman. </p> <p>However, WhatsApp has the ability to force the generation of new encryption keys for offline users, unbeknown to the sender and recipient of the messages, and to make the sender re-encrypt messages with new keys and send them again for any messages that have not been marked as delivered.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The recipient is not made aware of this change in encryption, while the sender is only notified if they have opted-in to encryption warnings in settings, and only after the messages have been re-sent. This re-encryption and rebroadcasting effectively allows WhatsApp to intercept and read users’ messages.</p> <p>The security loophole was discovered by Tobias Boelter, a cryptography and security researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. He told the Guardian: “If WhatsApp is asked by a government agency to disclose its messaging records, it can effectively grant access due to the change in keys.”</p> <p>The vulnerability is not inherent to the Signal protocol. Open Whisper Systems’ messaging app, Signal, the app used and recommended by whistleblower Edward Snowden, does not suffer from the same vulnerability. If a recipient changes the security key while offline, for instance, a sent message will fail to be delivered and the sender will be notified of the change in security keys without automatically resending the message.</p> <p>WhatsApp’s implementation automatically resends an undelivered message with a new key without warning the user in advance or giving them the ability to prevent it.</p> <p>Boelter reported the vulnerability to Facebook in April 2016, but was told that Facebook was aware of the issue, that it was “expected behaviour” and wasn’t being actively worked on. The Guardian has verified the loophole still exists. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8168bf0de13542fd709bb691c5a643feee74ec0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8168bf0de13542fd709bb691c5a643feee74ec0c/0_112_3364_2019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The WhatsApp vulnerability calls into question the privacy of messages sent across the service used around the world, including by people living in oppressive regimes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The WhatsApp vulnerability calls into question the privacy of messages sent across the service used around the world, including by people living in oppressive regimes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcelo Sayão/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Steffen Tor Jensen, head of information security and digital counter-surveillance at the European-Bahraini Organisation for Human Rights, verified Boelter’s findings. He said: “WhatsApp can effectively continue flipping the security keys when devices are offline and re-sending the message, without letting users know of the change till after it has been made, providing an extremely insecure platform.”</p> <p>Boelter said: “[Some] might say that this vulnerability could only be abused to snoop on ‘single’ targeted messages, not entire conversations. This is not true if you consider that the WhatsApp server can just forward messages without sending the ‘message was received by recipient’ notification (or the double tick), which users might not notice. Using the retransmission vulnerability, the WhatsApp server can then later get a transcript of the whole conversation, not just a single message.”<br /></p> <p>The vulnerability calls into question the privacy of messages sent across the service, which is used around the world, including by people living in oppressive regimes. </p> <p>Professor Kirstie Ball, co-director and founder of the Centre for Research into Information, Surveillance and Privacy, called the existence of a vulnerability within WhatsApp’s encryption “a gold mine for security agencies” and “a huge betrayal of user trust”. She added: “It is a huge threat to freedom of speech, for it to be able to look at what you’re saying if it wants to. Consumers will say, I’ve got nothing to hide, but you don’t know what information is looked for and what connections are being made.”</p> <p>In the UK, the recently passed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/snoopers-charter-bill-becomes-law-extending-uk-state-surveillance\">Investigatory Powers Act</a> allows the government to intercept bulk data of users held by private companies, without suspicion of criminal activity, similar to the activity of the US National Security Agency uncovered by the Snowden revelations. The government also has the power to force companies to “maintain technical capabilities” that allow data collection through hacking and interception, and requires companies to remove “electronic protection” from data. Intentional or not, WhatsApp’s vulnerability to the end-to-end encryption could be used in such a way to facilitate government interception.</p> <p>Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group, said: “If companies claim to offer end-to-end encryption, they should come clean if it is found to be compromised....In the UK, the Investigatory Powers Act means that technical capability notices could be used to compel companies to introduce flaws – which could leave people’s data vulnerable.”</p> <p>A WhatsApp spokesperson told the Guardian: “Over 1 billion people use WhatsApp today because it is simple, fast, reliable and secure. At WhatsApp, we’ve always believed that people’s conversations should be secure and private. Last year, we gave all our users a better level of security by making every message, photo, video, file and call end-to-end encrypted by default. As we introduce features like end-to-end encryption, we focus on keeping the product simple and take into consideration how it’s used every day around the world.</p> <p>“In WhatsApp’s implementation of the Signal protocol, we have a “Show Security Notifications” setting (option under Settings &gt; Account &gt; Security) that notifies you when a contact’s security code has changed. We know the most common reasons this happens are because someone has switched phones or reinstalled WhatsApp. This is because in many parts of the world, people frequently change devices and Sim cards. In these situations, we want to make sure people’s messages are delivered, not lost in transit.”</p> <p>Asked to comment specifically on whether Facebook/WhatApps had accessed users’ messages and whether it had done so at the request of government agencies or other third parties, it directed the Guardian to its site that <a href=\"https://govtrequests.facebook.com\">details aggregate data on government requests by country</a>.</p> <p>WhatsApp later issued another statement saying: “WhatsApp does not give governments a ‘backdoor’ into its systems and would fight any government request to create a backdoor.”</p> <p>Concerns over the privacy of WhatsApp users has been repeatedly highlighted since Facebook acquired the company for $22bn in 2014. In August 2015, Facebook announced a change to the privacy policy governing WhatsApp that allowed the social network to merge data from WhatsApp users and Facebook, including phone numbers and app usage, for advertising and development purposes.</p> <p>Facebook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/17/facebook-halts-use-of-whatsapp-data-for-advertising-in-europe\">halted the use of the shared user data</a> for advertising purposes in November after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/whatsapp-pause-sharing-user-data-facebook-european-privacy-regulators-yahoo\">pressure from the pan-European data protection agency group</a> Article 29 Working Party in October.

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Japanese gaming company Nintendo has unveiled its new Nintendo Switch console at a presentation in Tokyo. </p> <p>The device, a hybrid that can be used both handheld and with a TV when in a dock, will go on sale on 3 March priced $299.99 in the US and £279.99 in the UK. Other European prices will vary, Nintendo said. </p> <p>The pricing is higher than had been rumoured and makes the Switch more expensive than rivals Sony’s PlayStation 4 and Microsoft’s Xbox One S.</p> <p>The new gaming platform wants to do everything at once, executives said, from the old-school fantasy of its flagship launch title, Zelda: Breath of the Wild, to party games played face-to-face rather than in front of a screen.</p> <p>The Switch “inherited all of Nintendo’s entertainment DNA” across the company’s broad line of products, said Shinya Takahashi, Nintendo’s head of software development. </p> <p>The presentation, which was streamed live, ended with a surprise revelation: the long-delayed Breath of the Wild, originally planned as an exclusive to the Wii U platform, will go on sale with the new console. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/12/nintendo-switch-is-this-hybrid-console-the-future-of-gaming\">Nintendo Switch: is this hybrid console the future of gaming?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first Mario game for the platform will not debut until later in the year: Super Mario Odyssey, “a large Mario sandbox world,” in the words of producer Yoshiaki Koizumi, will exile Mario to an unknown world – our own. Footage from the game shown at the presentation featured Mario leaping through realistic forests and over yellow taxi cabs. Koizumi also produced the Mario Galaxy franchise for the company. </p> <p>And Nintendo may be mending fences with third-party developers: Electronic Arts executive Patrick Soderland said the game company’s wildly popular Fifa football franchise would return to the Switch after years of refusing to make versions of its games for the Wii U. The hugely popular building game Minecraft will also be coming to the Switch, its makers confirmed<br /></p> <p> Nintendo is also rolling back its digital rights-management protections slightly: the company will not region-lock its games, Kimishima told the audience, meaning that Switch games will be playable whether or not they were purchased in the same country as the console itself. </p> <p>The company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/12/nintendo-switch-is-this-hybrid-console-the-future-of-gaming\">merged its living-room console and handheld device divisions</a> to create the Switch: the machine has a built-in screen so it can function as a tablet-sized handheld gaming device, but it also plugs into a dock attached to a television. Its single complex controller splits into two simpler controllers for in-person multiplayer.<br /></p> <p>Nintendo has doubled down on its non-standard hardware design largely in the service of keeping users off the couch. Kouichi Kawamoto, general hardware director for Nintendo, introduced a game called 1, 2 Switch similar to the simple, sometimes acrobatic Wii Sports games that came with the company’s original Wii system. Players quick-draw their controllers like gunslingers in a western or battle with swords, among other activities. 1, 2 Switch “isn’t a game you play facing the screen, it is a game that is primarily played through face-to-face interaction,” Kawamoto said. The executive suggested bringing the game to parties and called it “an icebreaker for all kinds of fun communication.”</p> <p>A new online multiplayer service debuts with the Switch, but like competitors Sony and Xbox, Nintendo’s service will be subscriber-only by the end of the year, with a grace period of a few months for early adopters.</p> <p>Among other new game announcements: <br /></p> <ul> <li>Nintendo will make a sequel to its Wii U paint-gun game Splatoon for the Switch</li> <li>Along the lines of popular 1980s title Punch-Out, Nintendo will release Arms, a boxing game starring creatures with long springs for arms, playable online against other Switchers</li> <li>The presentation solved a second missing-games case: Xenoblade Chronicles 2, the long-rumored and now-confirmed sequel to the popular 2010 Wii action-RPG, will debut on the Switch</li> <li>Eccentric developer Suda51 did not quite say a new No More Heroes game was on its way, but he did say “Travis Touchdown is coming to the Nintendo Switch.”</li> <li>Toshiro Nagoshi of one-time Nintendo nemesis Sega said his company “will consider new games for the Nintendo Switch and present them soon.”</li> </ul> <p><strong>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/12/nintendo-switch-is-this-hybrid-console-the-future-of-gaming\">Is Nintendo’s Switch hybrid console the future of gaming?</a></strong></p>',\n",

That’s not going to go down easy with companies that are creating robots and AIs,” he told the Guardian.</p> <p>“If I create a robot, and that robot creates something that could be patented, should I own that patent or should the robot? If I sell the robot, should the intellectual property it has developed go with it? These are not easy questions to answer, and that goes right to the heart of this debate,” Morgan added.</p> <p>The full house of the European Parliament will vote on the draft proposals in February, which will need to be approved by absolute majority.</p>',\n",

They said: “We have been delighted by the steady advancements in the quality of our product and have received great feedback from our Beta program. At the same time, we have been racing against a clock of ever-diminishing funds.”</p> <p>When the drone was first available for pre-order, it promised class-leading capability for half the final expected cost. Buyers could pay $499 to pre-order the drone, which was to have a 1080p video camera and a 12 megapixel still camera strapped to a drone with a 20-minute battery life. The downside was that the pre-order amount was charged immediately, which the company said “helps us reduce risk”.</p> <p>As well as the basic drone functionality, the Lily distinguished itself with selfie features: owners would have worn a tracking device, which would let the drone follow them around, filming and snapping shots all the while.</p> <p>But none of that came to pass. Balaresque and Bradlow wrote: “We are very sorry and disappointed that we will not be able to deliver your flying camera. We hope our contribution will help pave the way for the exciting future of our industry.”</p> <p>The death of the Lily underscores the risk for consumers in funding pre-release technology. While the Lily did not directly turn to crowdfunding, steering clear of platforms such as Kickstarter in order to raise funds directly through pre-orders, the outcome has been reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/19/trouble-kickstarter-massive-projects-hit-rocks-coolest-zano\">prominent Kickstarter failures</a> such as the Zano drone.</p> <p>Launched in 2015, Zano was a British “nano drone” that raised £2.3m on Kickstarter, then declared bankruptcy before the year was out. Like the Lily, it was sold on its selfie ability: “Taking your selfies to new heights” was one tagline.</p> <p>Unlike the Lily, however, a few Zanos made it out to purchasers – 600 of the 15,000 that were pre-sold – but users reported widespread technical errors.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/12/googles-research-sibling-x-shuts-down-drones-project\"><strong>Google’s research sibling X shuts down drones project</strong></a><br /></li> </ul>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>In 2013, Nintendo opened a new research and development facility in its home town of Kyoto, Japan. Usually, a consumer technology manufacturer opening a new office wouldn’t be news, but this was different: the $350m building would house both the company’s handheld and console gaming R&amp;D teams. </p> <p>In the past, these groups had been kept apart, producing very different hardware and games for the different markets – now they would be merged. At the time, analysts thought this was to improve functionality between the Wii U and 3DS, but now we understand this was not the end goal – the end goal was Switch. This hybrid gaming system, which works as both a portable machine and a home console, now looks to represent Nintendo’s future in the games industry. But what does that mean?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e213f9c9b91a791b111d0d1bc77bbc5f862bf9b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e213f9c9b91a791b111d0d1bc77bbc5f862bf9b9/421_155_3128_1877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nintendo Switch – a true synergy of the handheld and home form factors.But does anyone want that?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We’ll find out much more about the device in a series of Livestream videos on Friday, but as ever with a new Nintendo product, pundits are questioning its role in the gaming ecosystem. They questioned the dual-screen design of the Nintendo DS after the vast success of the Gameboy; they questioned the boxy, toy-like GameCube, and they stifled laughter at the Wii, with its cheap off-the-shelf components and weird motion controller. Most of these, of course, went on to great success, with Nintendo’s famed business philosophy – the innovative use of withered technology – ensuring that money was always made on hardware as well as software. PlayStation and Xbox machines were selling better, but often at a loss.</p> <p>But the Wii U really derailed things. The first console of the merged R&amp;D generation failed to convince consumers that a home console needed a second handheld screen. There was talk of unique asymmetric multiplayer experiences, but few materialised; third-party publishers shied away and even Nintendo itself under-delivered on truly in-depth, interesting support for the GamePad. Since its launch in 2012, the console has sold around 14m units. PlayStation 4 did that in a year.<br /></p> <p>Switch is an extension of the Wii U philosophy – a machine that offers two play forms, one involving your television, the other utilising a smaller handheld screen. The difference here is that the handheld component is the main console, and it is portable beyond the home. It’s a true synergy of the handheld and home form factors.</p> <p>But does anyone want that? Right now, analysts are uncertain. One reason is that both the home and portable experiences may be compromised by this merged approach. “I don’t doubt the software will be good but aspects of the hardware concern me,” says veteran industry journalist Ben Parfitt. “Lots of people have very quickly dismissed any suggestion that a 720p screen is inadequate for the device, but I’m not so certain. Most smartphones now pack a higher resolution into a smaller display, and I worry that Switch visuals may be noticeably inferior than the target market is used to. With lots of gamers buying 4K screens for PS4 Pro and Xbox One S, having a device that needs a processing boost from its dock just to achieve 1080p seems implausibly dated.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5uik5fgIaI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f5uik5fgIaI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Smartphones have become the interesting factor here. For years Nintendo resisted bringing its intellectual property to mobile phones, but in 2015, a deal with Japanese mobile gaming specialist DeNa reversed that, leading to the successful releases Miitomo and Super Mario Run. Last year we also saw the phenomenon of Pokémon Go, downloaded over 500m times, with Nintendo receiving a share of the spoils from microtransactions. But the impact of this strategy has had wider ramifications for Nintendo.</p> <p>“The general view during the first six months of the year was that 2016 would be dead for Nintendo,” says Chris Dring at industry news site GamesIndustry.Biz. “No Wii U games of note, a smattering of Japanese RPGs in what was probably the 3DS’s final year, and a couple of experimental mobile titles. Then Pokémon Go happened.</p> <p>“The 3DS has been flying high since then, the Pokémon Sun and Moon games are the fastest selling titles Nintendo has ever released – which is astonishing. More 3DS games were sold in the UK last month than at any other point in that platform’s history – not bad for a machine that was coming to an end just six months ago.”</p> <p>In short, if Nintendo’s dalliances with the huge smartphone market have been this successful, and have had such a positive effect on its legacy machines, why bother with an experimental hybrid system? Why not continue to support the 3DS and Wii lines and concentrate handheld gaming concepts on the smartphone sector?<br /></p> <p>Perhaps part of the answer is control. Nintendo has always jealously guarded its game brands, and access to its hardware. The controversial “Nintendo Seal of Quality” that has restricted what third-party publishers could release on its consoles since the days of the NES, has created an ecosystem entirely controlled by Nintendo itself. But it cannot maintain that sort of rigid autocratic power in the mobile sector, where it is subject to the hardware and infrastructures of other companies like Apple, Google and Samsung.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9beefa6aca0f520495682819c9f05ebe6ed4e851\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9beefa6aca0f520495682819c9f05ebe6ed4e851/52_29_987_592/500.png\" alt=\"The new Zelda game on the Nintendo Switch.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new Zelda game on the Nintendo Switch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Furthermore, games work in a very different way in the smartphone sector, where design, structure and monetisation are all governed by free-to-play mechanics. Super Mario Run is very much a mobile phone rethinking of Mario rather than a mobile port of the classic Super Mario Bros series. It’s an endless runner (an accepted smartphone genre), with a try-now-pay-later format that suits the premium-averse phone user. Although Animal Crossing and Fire Emblem titles are coming to mobile, they’re likely to be similarly altered and rethought for this market. We’ve seen from some poor reviews for Super Mario Run that Nintendo’s veteran fanbase haven’t been happy – they want to full, epic gaming experiences they’re used to. Hence the Switch and its hybrid format. This way Nintendo gets to control content, design and experience.</p> <p>But even if we accept this, the Switch proposition is troubled – it relies on games that will essentially play in the same way between the docked and portable formats. The thing is, handheld games aren’t just scaled down versions of their home console counterparts; they have a different aesthetic, and they are designed to meet different patterns of play. The most popular 3DS titles, the likes of Pokémon, Animal Crossing, Monster Hunter and Fire Emblem Fates, are designed to be played over long periods, but in shorter, less focused interactions – many have turn-based battles rather than real-time, so you can break off and think; their environments are often broken into smaller sections, so you get a sense of achievement in shorter, more scattered sessions. These games fit in with the world around you; they don’t constantly demand your full attention in the way that home console titles do. </p> <p>So can the Switch produce console games that work outside of the home in this way? Arguably, Sony’s PSP and Vita handhelds never sold as well because they really <em>were</em> an attempt to bring the console experience to the handheld – and not as many people wanted that. “The Switch proposition is interesting but fairly complex and not entirely original,” says Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at <a href=\"https://technology.ihs.com/\">IHS</a>. “Historically, there has been very limited success in the device category which offers a powerful gaming tablet which can be used as a home console – Nvidia’s Shield Tablet for example. Nintendo has a bucketful of IP and a more unique form factor to sway consumers to invest in the platform but I think the offer has to displace existing tablet and home console use, which is quite a challenge.”</p> <p>Switch then, is a fascinating piece of hardware, which is utterly typical of Nintendo. But while the Wii effectively created its own niche of motion-controlled gaming, Switch is designed to sit in between other markets. The question is whether anyone wants that space to be filled. With the rapidly diversifying home console and smartphone sectors, the former appealing to “hardcore” gamers, the latter to the casual market, the industry is beginning to stratify along clear lines. Switch adds a kink in the line, but will it trip Nintendo up?<br /></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/11/nintendo-switch-what-were-expecting-from-the-new-console\">Nintendo Switch: what we’re expecting from the new console</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/21/nintendo-switch-new-portable-console-wii-u\">Nintendo Switch: can the new console succeed where Wii U failed?</a></li> </ul>',\n",

We ended our exploration of high-altitude UAVs for internet access shortly after,” an X spokesperson said. “By comparison, at this stage the economics and technical feasibility of Project Loon [its high-altitude balloon project] present a much more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world. Many people from the Titan team are now using their expertise as part of other high-flying projects at X, including Loon and Project Wing.”</p> <p>In ditching solar-powered drones, X has taken a different stance to rival Facebook, which has gone all-in on the technology with its Aquila project.

If the bill passes it will <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/23/censor-non-conventional-sex-acts-online-internet-pornography\">outlaw the depiction online of a range of legal-to-perform sex acts</a>. </p> <p>Its passage is highly likely, with support in parliament from both Labour and the Conservatives, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/28/lib-dems-to-oppose-uk-plan-to-block-porn-sites-without-age-checks\">only the Liberal Democrats indicating they will oppose it</a>. </p> <p>Kaye’s objections focus on the risk posed by age verification requirements to individuals’ privacy. In a letter to the UK’s ambassador to the UN, he says he is concerned that the new rules “fall short of the standards of international human rights law”. </p> <p>“I am concerned that the age verification provisions give the government access to information of viewing habits and citizen data,” Kaye writes, pointing out that under rules introduced elsewhere in the bill the data could be shared across government and the private sector without consent. </p> <p>“Identity disclosure requirements in law allow authorities to more easily identify persons, eradicating anonymous expression,” he goes on, adding that such anonymity has been “one of the most important advances facilitated by the internet”.</p> <p>Kaye says he is also concerned by the lack of judicial oversight given to the role of the age verification regulator, which will be empowered to block websites it judges to have insufficient adequate age checks or which host content that would not be passed for UK DVD release. </p> <p>“Finally, I express concern at the cumulative effect of the digital economy bill and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/19/extreme-surveillance-becomes-uk-law-with-barely-a-whimper\">Investigatory Powers Act</a>,” Kaye writes. “Together, these two pieces of legislation constitute a significant tightening control over the internet in the UK.</p> <p>“Therefore, while I am cognisant of the need to protect children against harmful content, I am concerned that the provisions under the bill are not an effective way for achieving this objective as they fall short of the standards of international human rights law. </p> <p>“The bill contains insufficient procedures without adequate oversight, overly broad definitions and lack of data-sharing safeguards that unduly interferes with the rights of freedom of expression and privacy.”</p> <p>Jim Killock, the executive director of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.openrightsgroup.org/\">Open Rights Group</a>, which has campaigned against the digital economy bill, welcomed Kaye’s comments, which come ahead of House of Lords committee hearings on the bill expected later this month. </p> <p>“This bill creates huge problems of surveillance and privacy violations,” he said. “We hope the Lords take note of this letter as they try to deal with this extremely messy, badly thought out bill. The age verification scheme is almost certain to go badly wrong as things stand.”</p> <p>The Conservative MP Claire Perry accused Kaye of using emotive language and said his intervention “really clouds the issue and distracts from an important principle”.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which is behind the bill, said: “These measures will ensure children have the same protections online as they do offline. There is no question of the government collecting data on viewing habits and we are in discussions with the Information Commissioner’s Office to make sure data protection standards are complied with.”</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<blockquote> <p>I have a 10-year-old <a href=\"http://acersupport.com/acerpanam/desktop/0000/Acer/AspireT660/AspireT660sp2.shtml\">Acer Aspire T660</a> desktop with 640MB of memory and Windows Vista Premium installed. The whole system is getting slower and slower, including the instruction to print documents and/or photos to my HP printer/copier/scanner.</p> <p>I use the PC for email, online banking, word processing and spreadsheets (Microsoft Office), Skype and some games. Broadband here to the house is poor.</p> <p>Should I get another desktop PC or a laptop? How much do I need to pay for a faster replacement which gives me the facilities I have now?</p> <p>I am retired (I’m 78) so I probably have a limited number of years ahead to enjoy a good replacement. <strong>John</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>You must have an enormous amount of patience to run Windows Vista in 640MB or even 2GB of memory, and your best investment would have been to add as much memory as your PC could handle – in this case, 4GB. Sadly, it’s too late for that: it’s not worth spending money on a machine that is at the end of its useful life. On the plus side, almost anything will be a huge improvement.</p> <h2>Desktop or laptop?</h2> <p>You already have a desktop PC so you have the space, and you might be able to reuse your existing keyboard, mouse and screen.</p> <p>Desktops have more space inside for cooling so they can run hotter, faster, cheaper processors than laptops. They are also much easier to upgrade and to repair. As a result, desktop PCs last up to twice as long as laptops – in my recent experience, eight to 10 years rather than four or five years – so they are much better value.</p> <p>Desktop PCs also have better ergonomics – you can use them without hunching over – and usually have better keyboards and bigger screens. All of those are particularly beneficial to older users like us.</p> <h2>Different types of desktop</h2> <p>There are many different types of desktop PC. The traditional tower system is the most flexible, but there are dozens of smaller towers, including slimline and small form factor (SFF) versions.</p> <p>There are also lots of mini-and micro-desktops that are not very expandable, and may use the same chips you would find in a laptop. They have their uses, but they sacrifice functionality for what they save in space.</p> <p>Then there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2016/oct/20/which-all-in-one-pc-should-i-buy-for-home-use\">all-in-one PCs</a>, where the computer electronics are behind the screen. With these, again, you may lose the chance to do easy upgrades and repairs. Also, if either the PC or the screen fails, you lose the whole machine.</p> <h2>Specification</h2> <p>Today’s standard mid-range desktops have 8GB of memory, a 1TB hard drive, a DVD/RW optical drive and Microsoft Windows 10. Many also have built-in card readers and Wi-Fi, though you’ll get much better performance with the Ethernet cable you’re using with your Acer.</p> <p>All mid-range desktops should therefore cost pretty much the same. The biggest variation comes from the price of the processor.</p> <p>Intel has two main designs: Atom and Core. The Core chips are the fastest, and usually, the higher the code number, the better – and the costlier. The Atom chips are variously branded Atom, Celeron and Pentium. The Pentium versions are generally, but not always, better.</p> <p>Other things being equal, go for the fastest CPU, because it will last longer. You can compare speeds by using Notebookcheck’s <a href=\"http://www.notebookcheck.net/Mobile-Processors-Benchmark-List.2436.0.html\">Comparison of Mobile Processors (CPU Benchmarks)</a>. You don’t need to bother with the numbers: the higher up the table, the better. Anything in the top 200 is good. (My own 2011-vintage desktop is still in the top 100.) I’d have doubts about anything that didn’t make the top 500, with the quad-core Pentium N3700 (519th) or J3710 being as low as I’d go.</p> <h2>Possible desktops</h2> <p>My current cheap recommendation is the <a href=\"http://shop.lenovo.com/gb/en/desktops/ideacentre/510s/\">Lenovo Ideacentre 510S</a>. This is a traditional tower available in a vast range of specifications, with plenty of useful ports on the front. John Lewis has a version with an Intel Core i3-6100 processor, 8GB of memory, 1TB hard drive and DVD/RW for <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/lenovo-ideacentre-510s-tower-pc-intel-core-i3-8gb-1tb-black/p2877309\">£299.95</a>.</p> <p>The 3.7GHz Intel Core i3-6100 is remarkably quick for an i3 chip, and can be almost as fast as a Core i5-6200U. (Of course, it runs much hotter, but that doesn’t matter in a desktop.)</p> <p>PC World has the same Ideacentre 510S with 4GB of memory instead of 8GB for <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/desktop-pcs/desktop-pcs/lenovo-ideacentre-510s-desktop-pc-10146051-pdt.html\">£259.99</a>. This has a much cheaper Celeron G3900 processor, which is <a href=\"http://www.cpu-world.com/Compare/269/Intel_Celeron_Dual-Core_G3900_vs_Intel_Core_i3_i3-6100.html\">slower than the Core i3-6100</a> but still a good performer. Even if it had the same CPU, you’d be giving up £50-worth of memory to save £40.</p> <p>HP’s <a href=\"http://store.hp.com/UKStore/Merch/Product.aspx?id=T1J34EA&amp;opt=ABU&amp;sel=DTP\">Slimline 411</a> range of desktops offers cheaper but much less powerful options. For example, you could get one with a Pentium N3700, 4GB of memory, 1TB hard drive and DVD/RW for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/hp-slimline-411-a020na-desktop-pc-intel-pentium-4gb-ram-1tb/p2509179\">£229.95</a> from John Lewis, or with 8GB for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.argos.co.uk/product/5481710\">£299.99</a> from Argos.</p> <p>If you buy direct from HP, you can add 3 years of “pickup and return” service for only £29, which is a bargain.</p> <p>But the Pentium N3700 and (almost identical) J3710 really belong in cheap netbooks and Chromebooks, not in desktops. There are plenty of smartphones with faster processors than the Celeron N3050.</p> <p>You can certainly get fantastic value for money if you spend £180 to £230 on a desktop, but you can get much better performance for £299.99.</p> <h2>Screen</h2> <p>As mentioned, you could use your existing monitor with your new desktop PC. However, I would strongly recommend buying a new one: screens have improved a lot in the past decade. Look for something in the 22-24in range with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which is Full HD.</p> <p>The 21.5in <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/pc-monitors/pc-monitors/aoc-e2270swhn-full-hd-21-5-led-monitor-10141924-pdt.html\">AOC e2270Swhn</a> would be a good choice if you want something cheap – it’s £79.99 at PC World – or try Amazon UK’s best seller, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/BenQ-GL2250HM-Widescreen-Multimedia-Speakers/dp/B00B7ZE0G2/\">BenQ GL2250HM</a>, at £89.99 (21.5in) or £119.99 (24in).</p> <p>Even better, you could get a 22in Samsung S22F350 for <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/samsung-s22f350fhu-full-hd-led-monitor-22-/p3043718\">£89.95 at John Lewis</a> or <a href=\"http://www.argos.co.uk/product/5318931\">£99.99 at Argos</a>. Alternatively, go for the 24in Samsung S24F350 for <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/samsung-s24f350fhu-full-hd-led-monitor-24-/p3044058\">£116.95 at John Lewis</a>, or the S24F356 for <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/pc-monitors/pc-monitors/samsung-s24f356-full-hd-24-led-monitor-10146160-pdt.html\">£129.99 at PC World</a>. (You won’t be surprised to hear that John Lewis is currently out of stock of both Samsungs.)</p> <h2>Software </h2> <p>If you have software on DVD, such as Microsoft Office, you can install it on your new PC. It’s a good idea to uninstall it from your old PC first. Windows 10 PCs also tend to come with a trial version of the current Microsoft Office, so uninstall that before you install your old copy.</p> <p>You can also uninstall whichever anti-virus product comes pre-installed on your new PC. Windows 10’s built-in Defender is good enough for most people, as long as you don’t turn off the SmartScreen filter or the cloud integration. Of course, you can always install a free alternative such as Avast, Avira, BitDefender, Sophos or a similar product.</p> <p>The major worry is your HP printer/copier/scanner. Windows 10 will install basic drivers that should work, but you will probably need to <a href=\"http://support.hp.com/gb-en/document/c04658195\">download a model-specific driver from HP’s website</a>. If HP doesn’t provide a “full feature” driver, you will probably lose some scanning features, and possibly copy/fax features as well.</p> <p>If so, <a href=\"https://www.hamrick.com/\">Hamrick’s VueScan</a> is a third-party solution that works with a lot of old scanners. It’s not free, but there’s a free trial version.</p> <p><strong>Have you got another question for Jack?

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Microsoft workers on the “online safety team” were forced to view photos and videos of “indescribable sexual assaults”, “horrible brutality”, murder and child abuse, resulting in severe post-traumatic stress disorder, according to a lawsuit. </p> <p>The complaint, filed on behalf of two employees and their families, outlined the “inhumane and disgusting content” the moderators viewed on a regular basis and alleged that the psychological impact has been so extreme that the men are “triggered” by simply seeing children and can no longer use computers without breaking down.</p> <p>The lawsuit, which accused Microsoft of “negligent infliction of emotional distress”, provides a window into the often secretive world of online moderation and sheds light on the intense suffering of tech workers responsible for detecting and reporting digital content “designed to entertain the most twisted and sick minded people in the world”. </p> <p>“It’s horrendous,” said Ben Wells, one of the attorneys who filed the suit in Washington state, where Microsoft is headquartered. “It’s bad enough just to see a child get sexually molested. Then there are murders. Unspeakable things are done to these children.” </p> <p>If the suit prevails, it could have ramifications for corporations across the industry, and Wells said he hopes the case inspires others to speak out about poor working conditions.</p> <p>A Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement that the company “disagrees” with the claims in the suit and “takes seriously its responsibility to remove and report imagery of child sexual exploitation and abuse being shared on its services, as well as the health and resiliency of the employees who do this important work”.</p> <p>Plaintiffs Henry Soto and Greg Blauert both worked on the online safety team, which is responsible for complying with legislation passed in 2008 requiring tech companies to report child abuse images and other crimes. </p> <p>Microsoft did not warn the workers about the dangers of this line of work and the potential for “debilitating injuries”, according to the suit, which was filed in December and was publicly <a href=\"http://courthousenews.com/workers-on-porn-detail-sue-microsoft-for-injuries/\">reported</a> this week. </p> <p>When Soto was “involuntarily transferred” to the unit in 2008, he had “God-like” status, which meant he could view any customer’s communications, the suit said. His job involved assisting law enforcement in breaking up “crime rings” and “violent groups” and required him to view “many thousands of photographs and videos” of violence and brutality. </p> <p>“Many people simply cannot imagine what Mr Soto had to view on a daily basis as most people do not understand how horrible and inhumane the worst people in the world can be,” his lawyers wrote. Blauert, who was hired as a full-time employee in 2012, was also required to “review thousands of images of child pornography, adult pornography and bestiality that graphically depicted the violence and depravity of the perpetrators.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>[Soto] suffered from an internal video screen in his head and could see disturbing images</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although Microsoft created a “wellness program” and offered a counselor, the services were insufficient and ineffective and the company failed to help the workers understand the “vicarious trauma” and PTSD they were suffering, according to the suit. </p> <p>Program authorities advised the workers to take walks and smoke breaks and suggested Blauert play video games to manage his symptoms, the complaint said. Later, however, his supervisors allegedly gave him a poor evaluation for “lack of production and too much time playing video games”. </p> <p>When Soto initially met with psychiatrists, he said he was experiencing sleep disturbances, nightmares, anxiety and “suffered from an internal video screen in his head and could see disturbing images”. As time progressed, he began experiencing visual hallucinations, panic attacks in public, disassociation and depression. </p> <p>“One of the triggers for him is children,” Wells told the Guardian. “At times, he can’t look at his own son … He can’t see a knife in the kitchen … He can’t look at computers.” </p> <p>Soto eventually went on medical leave. </p> <p>Blauert suffered a physical and mental breakdown in 2013 when he was experiencing “intractable crying, insomnia, anxiety and PTSD”, the suit said. He is now triggered by adults who look like “potential abusers” and “fears for the safety of children he meets”. He is also unable to look at any “child related content” on computers and has not returned to work due to the triggers, according to the complaint. </p> <p>The men are seeking damages, and the complaint also outlined potential reforms that would make the “online safety” job less harmful. That includes mandatory rotations out of the program, more time off, weekly meetings with a psychologist and a spousal wellness program. </p> <p>Microsoft declined to comment on the specific claims, but said in a statement: “The health and safety of our employees who do this difficult work is a top priority.” </p> <p>The corporation also said it provides mandatory psychological support each month, uses technology to “reduce the realism of the imagery”, reassigns employees who no longer want to do this work, and limits the amount of time the employees spend on the moderation. </p> <p>Microsoft and other tech corporations need to do a much better job “protecting people who are doing heroic work”, added Wells. “They saved children’s lives. They put people in jail that deserved to be in jail.”</p> <p>The attorney said he believes other tech corporations have similar challenges and inadequate or nonexistent wellness programs. In recent years, there have been past reports of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/10/content-moderation/\">alarming conditions</a> for moderators who review Facebook, Twitter, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/technology/19screen.html\">YouTube and other companies</a>. </p> <p>“The public needs to understand that this work is not being done by a computer,” Wells said. </p>',\n",

The committee is due to review the data retention scheme in late 2018.</p> <p>Patton said the review of the law was more urgent given the request from the Attorney General’s Department for submissions on a proposal to expand the scheme to grant access to litigants in civil lawsuits, which could include divorce cases or even copyright infringement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/07/data-retention-isps-australia-counter-terrorism-laws-advocates\">Data retention black hole: no one knows how many ISPs Australia has, say experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the law now stands, <a href=\"https://www.ag.gov.au/NationalSecurity/DataRetention/Pages/Frequentlyaskedquestions.aspx#data\">only specified security and intelligence agencies</a> can request metadata collected under the scheme. The joint committee recommended in its report on the legislation that civil litigants be prohibited from being able to access the data.<br /></p> <p>But the AGD said in its consultation paper there was “the risk that restricting parties to civil proceedings’ access to such data could adversely impact the effective operation of the civil justice system”.</p> <p>It appealed to “stakeholders with an interest in the civil justice system and privacy” <a href=\"https://www.ag.gov.au/Consultations/Pages/Access-to-telecommunications-data-in-civil-proceedings.aspx\">to make submissions on the issue</a> in mid-December and it will receive them until 27 January.</p> <p>Patton told Guardian Australia that the review needed to be brought forward because of the call for submissions and the encroaching deadline for industry compliance.</p> <p>“What we’re saying is let’s not wait another year – firstly because it’s a debacle in its own right and secondly, if the government or the AGD has this idea of expanding it to include civil litigation, then that really should go back to the PJCIS.”</p> <p>IA gave evidence to the committee’s original inquiry into the law in late 2014, arguing that the proposed legislation was “fundamentally flawed” and drafted by lawyers who did not fully understand the internet.<br /></p> <p>“Our fears have already been proven prescient,” wrote Patton in his letter addressed to Michael Sukkar, the Liberal party MP and committee chair, on Tuesday. The committee and the AGD have been contacted for comment. </p> <p>Under the act, specified telecommunications providers, primarily internet service providers, are required to have systems in place by April 2017 to retain all their customers’ metadata for two years.</p> <p>But even then, Patton and IA believe it will be unlikely to achieve its purported purposes.</p> <p>Discrepancies in how those providers are meeting their obligations, as well as questions over how compliance will be monitored, means the scheme is arguably “of dubious benefit for its stated purpose of combating terrorism”, according to Patton.</p> <p>IA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/07/data-retention-isps-australia-counter-terrorism-laws-advocates\">believes there to be more ISPs in Australia</a> than the 180 that were granted funding from the AGD to help meet their costs of compliance, and that there are therefore hundreds of providers not known to the department and who will not be collecting and storing data as required to under the law. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It has clearly failed to deliver what the law enforcement agencies had sought for so long</p> <footer> <cite>Laurie Patton</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“If we must have data retention, then surely we should aim to have legislation that will work?”</p> <p>Patton reiterated IA’s concerns to Sukkar that the costs of the scheme will be passed on to consumers, with PricewaterhouseCoopers’ estimate of the $738m cost of compliance to the industry over 10 years thought to be based on incomplete data. </p> <p>Security agencies had sought a data retention scheme for more than a decade but successive attorney generals had resisted, he said.</p> <p>“This exercise has become a monumental stuff-up.

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Facebook has unveiled measures to establish stronger ties between the social network and the news industry, allowing for collaboration on product development, new ways for publishers to make money, and training for newsrooms and readers.</p> <p>The announcement of the Facebook Journalism Project comes in the wake of heightened scrutiny of the social network’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/22/mark-zuckerberg-appears-to-finally-admit-facebook-is-a-media-company\">role as a distributor of news</a>, which saw the company accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-fake-news-election-conspiracy-theories\">failing to tackle the spread of misinformation</a> in the run-up to the US presidential election. At the same time, Facebook and Google are taking the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/jun/15/google-facebook-publishers-network-collaborate-trends-report\">lion’s share of online advertising revenue</a> while newsrooms cut costs and make lay-offs.</p> <p>Many of the measures in the Facebook Journalism Project have been unveiled separately before, but the announcement highlights the company’s commitment to the content news organizations provide.</p> <p>“We’ve been working on this for a long time. Our media partners want a deeper engagement, not just at a business level, but a product/engineering level,” said Fidji Simo, Facebook’s director of product, who is leading the project.</p> <p>She said the program is linked to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/06/building-a-better-news-feed-for-you/\">news feed values</a> that Facebook announced in June 2016. In a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/06/building-a-better-news-feed-for-you/\">blogpost</a>, Facebook’s VP of product management, Adam Mosseri, revealed the news feed’s primary role was to show content from friends and family, but the other two roles are to inform and entertain. </p> <p>Simo said: “We are making sure that journalism thrives as part of the ‘inform’ axis.”</p> <p>“We are not a traditional media company and we are not a traditional tech company,” she added, reiterating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/22/mark-zuckerberg-appears-to-finally-admit-facebook-is-a-media-company\">Mark Zuckerberg’s words from late December</a>. “We build technology that helps people connect and be informed. This means working well with the news industry.”</p> <p>The announcement comes the week after Facebook appointed former CNN anchor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/06/facebook-hires-campbell-brown-media-partnerships\">Campbell Brown</a> to lead the news partnerships team. </p> <p>Major news organizations already talk to Facebook’s news partnerships team regularly, but now they will gain access to the technology company’s engineers to develop products – whether that’s a new storytelling or ad format – collaboratively. This will take the form of roundtables, hackathons and shared online groups.</p> <p>An example of the types of products that will be launched include a way to present packages of stories on Facebook (a feature requested by newsrooms) called “collections”; ads that appear in the middle of videos and live streams; and a tool that allows readers to subscribe to publications directly from Facebook. With <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/05/facebook-live-social-media-live-streaming\">Facebook Live</a>, publishers will be able to designate journalists as contributors so they can broadcast live on behalf of the page without needing login details for the publisher’s Facebook account.</p> <p>“I’m pleased to see the scale of the program and it’s a recognition that Facebook see themselves as part of the news ecosystem,” said <a href=\"https://firstdraftnews.com/author/cwardle/\">Claire Wardle</a> from First Draft News. “In the past, it’s been difficult for news organizations to have access to engineers and the engineers didn’t have any understanding of the news business.”</p> <p>The Washington Post’s chief information officer, Shailesh Prakash, agreed. “We often hear about a product only after they are pretty much done,” he said, citing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/13/bbc-news-guardian-facebook-instant-articles\">Instant Articles as an example</a>. “Even with an early partner roll-out, the big decisions have been made in terms of user interface and workflow. It’s much more effective if we can be in on the beginning.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e971342e412f7b12a9b541ea38508b6815c273d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e971342e412f7b12a9b541ea38508b6815c273d/0_274_2234_1340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This photo combo of images provided by Facebook demonstrates some of the new measures Facebook is taking to curb the spread of fake news on its huge and influential social network. The company is focusing on the “worst of the worst” offenders and partnering with outside fact-checkers to sort honest news reports from made-up stories that play to people’s passions and preconceived notions. (Facebook via AP)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Facebook is partnering with outside fact checkers to sort honest news reports from fake stories.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to Prakash, the announcement means that weekly phone calls between the Washington Post and Facebook will be supplemented by monthly face-to-face meetings. It is not clear how many other organizations will gain this level of access.</p> <p>For Vox Media publisher Melissa Bell, there is value in collaborating more effectively not only with Facebook but with other publishers.</p> <p>“In the past, there were a lot of questions everyone was trying to answer independently and that slowed down progress,” she said. “It’s imperative as an industry that we are collaborating to create profitable, trustworthy and productive media.”</p> <p>With regards to tackling the spread of misinformation on the platform, Facebook repeated the recently announced partnership with<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/facebook-flag-fake-news-fact-check\"> third-party fact checkers</a> and its plans to stop placing advertisements on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/15/facebook-google-fake-news-sites-ad-networks\">websites dedicated to “fake news”</a>.</p> <p>The company also pledged to promote news literacy among Facebook users through measures including a series of public service ads.</p> <p>“I think there’s more the platforms could be doing here,” Wardle said, suggesting they should embed media literacy tools into the platform, for example, through messaging at the point of sharing a story – something Facebook is doing for stories that have been fact-checked by third-party partners.</p> <p>“What do you do when crazy Uncle Bob is systematically sharing problematic content? Rather than telling him to go on a Facebook media literacy course you need tools baked into the platform,” she said.</p> <p>The project will also expand the training that Facebook offers major newsrooms to smaller local news organizations who have typically struggled to gain access to the social networking giant. Facebook will also launch e-learning courses in multiple languages and offer an analytics tool called CrowdTangle for nothing to its partners. Facebook will also help First Draft establish a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://firstdraftnews.com/first-draft-prepares-big-year-ahead-support-40-new-partners/\">virtual verification community</a> for eyewitness media generated during breaking news events.</p> <p>Both Wardle and Prakash said they would like Facebook to be more open with its data. For Wardle, it’s about helping independent researchers interrogate the decisions the social network is making. For example, there is social psychology research that indicates there’s a “boomerang effect” in debunking stories that makes some people more likely to click those stories. “This is such an important moment where we’re making big decisions. I’d love to see more of an evidence base,” she said.</p> <p>Prakash, on the other hand, wants more data about how Facebook users are interacting with news content, for example how far down an Instant Article people are scrolling and how long they watch videos.</p> <p>“I hope being involved in these [roundtable meetings] will give us more of a voice so that Facebook understands why we want that data,” he said.</p> <p>“Not all of these initiatives are going to work, but the fact that they are trying all of them should only be seen as a positive thing,” said Wardle.</p> <p>However, she is left with one major lingering request: “I really wish they would hire an editor-in-chief.”</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>This Friday at 4am BST, Nintendo will reveal its big bet on the future of the video game industry – the Switch. </p> <p>The company announced the successor to the beleaguered Wii U back in March 2015, after that machine dramatically failed to match the huge success of its namesake. Originally codenamed NX, we first glimpsed Switch last October, when Nintendo showed the unusual design concept for the first time. </p> <p>Billed as a hybrid system, Switch is both a home console and a portable gaming device. The built-in 6.2”, 720p display means games can be played outside the home, and a local multiplayer technology will mean owners will be able to meet up and play together wherever they are. But bring it back to your living room and place it into the dock and you can continue to play using your TV screen. </p> <p>Two controllers known as Joy-Cons slot either side of the screen, creating a standard control set-up (with the screen in the centre, rather like the 3DS), but they can also be slid out and used separately – or placed in a Joy Grip accessory, which make them brilliantly resemble a slightly frazzled cartoon dog. In an almost quaintly retrospective move, games will be sold on carts rather than optical discs.</p> <p>That’s currently most of what we know, but this Friday Nintendo promises to reveal more via its <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Misc-/Nintendo-Direct/Latest-Nintendo-Direct/Nintendo-Direct-698557.html\">Nintendo Direct</a> streaming service. Here’s what we’re expecting:</p> <h2><strong>The release date and price</strong></h2> <p>All we have is the vague March date, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/08/nikkei-nintendo-switch-will-sell-for-less-than-250-in-japan/\">a leaked potential retail price</a>: Y25,000, or about $225/£180 (although due to the import costs and state of the pound, we’re likely see something more akin to £200 or even £250 if this Yen price holds). We want to know if there are any bundles that include games or accessories. On the subject of the latter, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-01-11-officially-licensed-nintendo-switch-accessories-include-console-skins-in-car-charger-arcade-stick\">it seems we can expect</a> a pro controller (like the Wii U one, which offers a more conventional button layout), and even an arcade stick. </p> <h2><strong>More detail on the games</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2760d75868158491c586f17b183c725df0747462\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2760d75868158491c586f17b183c725df0747462/322_0_4798_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zelda Breath of the Wild\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zelda Breath of the Wild</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So far only a handful of titles have been confirmed, with Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild being the major draw. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/f5uik5fgIaI\">A teaser</a> shown last October hinted at a new Super Mario Bros, a Mario Kart thing and a possible port of Skyrim, the acclaimed action adventure from Bethesda. All those need to be confirmed, at the very least because they’re bloody exciting. Also, what plans does Nintendo have for its Virtual Console service which lets players download retro games? There’s talk of GameCube support which would be lovely. Super Mario Sunshine in HD? Oh yes.</p> <h2><strong>Technical specs to be revealed</strong></h2> <p>OK, so Nintendo has never been about bleeding edge technology, but we’d at least like to know what’s inside the box. We know there’s <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2016-nintendo-switch-spec-analysis\">an Nvidia Tegra chipset in there</a> (a decent smartphone-centred processor), but we don’t know which one. Can we expect 4K visuals when the machine is docked? We’ve also heard that the processing power may drop by 40% when the machine is undocked – which makes sense for battery life, but how will it affect graphically rich games? And on the subject of battery life, how long can we expect? Wii U’s GamePad launched with a poor 3-5 hours, and that wasn’t doing any of the processing grunt work. Fingers crossed for eight hours.</p> <h2><strong>An answer to the question: are the big publishers really onboard?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"209e7f1bb40d2eb9c86427f11772ccf83389e2d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/209e7f1bb40d2eb9c86427f11772ccf83389e2d3/17_95_1163_698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch partners\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nintendo Switch partners</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whenever a new Nintendo console comes out there’s this fun diplomatic period when the big powers of the industry – Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Activision, Bethesda, etc) – all make romantic proclamations about the hardware and their ardent support for it. Then everyone disappears faster than your teenage prom date, and Ubisoft releases a Just Dance title. This time, there have been firmer proclamations, including that Skyrim hint, but still – let’s see if we get a Mass Effect, Destiny or – ha ha – Read Dead Redemption 2.</p> <h2><strong>To find out if Nintendo has discovered the internet?</strong></h2> <p>OK, that’s a bit unfair, both the Wii U and 3DS offer a range of interesting multiplayer services: StreetPass, Miiverse, eShop, Virtual Console, as well as local and online multiplayer functionality. But via its tortured Friend Code and Nintendo Network ID systems, it can be complicated to manage your digital games and gaming friendships, and everything is tied to a particular machine – a stark contrast to the ‘download it once and it’s yours wherever you are’ approach favoured by much of the rest of the known consumer electronics universe. So will Switch offer a more seamless, accessible and intuitive digital service? It feels like this is quite important in the 21st century. <br /></p>',\n",

Sometimes that means being loose-lipped about features that don’t make it into the final product, a crime for which the internet will punish you in the same way as if you’d been caught drowning puppies. Other times, games are talked about for so long that they start to seem less like forms of entertainment and more like musty urban myths. But, for some reason, the last few weeks have seen the emergence of a clutch of games that had themselves in video game lore as forever “coming soon”.</p> <p>Starting life as a PlayStation 3 game, <strong>The Last Guardian</strong> (PS4) began its long, painful march through development hell in 2007. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/19/the-last-guardian-fumito-ueda-sony\">Created by game-making visionary Fumito Ueda</a>, it follows in the near-legendary footsteps of Ueda’s past works Ico, a wordless story of a boy and a girl escaping a giant, ethereal-looking castle, and Shadow Of The Colossus, in which you slaughtered a succession of office block-sized titans while gradually coming to the realisation that you were doing something unconscionably dreadful. In The Last Guardian you once again play a little boy escaping from a giant fortress, this time accompanied by Trico, an animal the size of a double-decker bus that looks like a cross between an alsatian puppy, a kitten and a baby bird. The fact that Trico is adorable despite being so huge is a testament to the talent at work. The game isn’t perfect, and graphically it can’t escape its PlayStation 3 roots, but the pairing of a small boy and his huge companion in environments that dwarf them both is hugely compelling, providing an experience unlike anything else in games or film. It shows that even nine years in development can’t keep a good idea down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a337a4fc56d7e5d24de0ed023068e4839ea67da1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a337a4fc56d7e5d24de0ed023068e4839ea67da1/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Final Fantasy XV.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Final Fantasy XV.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Square Enix</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/14/final-fantasy-xv-review\">Final Fantasy XV review: enthralling and slick, but problems lie beneath</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is lightweight compared with <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/14/final-fantasy-xv-review\">Final Fantasy XV</a></strong> (PS4, Xbox One) though, which Square Enix has been working on for over a decade. In some cases, devotees of the role-playing franchise have been keenly anticipating its arrival since they were children. Perhaps inevitably after that length of tormented gestation, it’s a bit of an antique, the voice acting and script conspiring to make its characters seem simultaneously artificial and slightly peculiar. The strange thing is that as you get to know them, you actually start to care about this band of freaky-looking muppets, with their stupid haircuts and phoned-in dialogue. Still, unless they started work on it in the 90s, it may be best not to hold your breath for Final Fantasy XVI.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31026d482b0fe5ce362737a3f8c8dee5f51ff6f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31026d482b0fe5ce362737a3f8c8dee5f51ff6f1/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No Man’s Sky.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No Man’s Sky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/02/no-mans-sky-foundation-play-update\">No Man\\'s Sky: Foundation update – a solid base to build on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pan-galactic explore-’em-up <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/12/no-mans-sky-review-hello-games\">No Man’s Sky</a></strong> (PS4, PC) was already in shops when it was written off for dead by factions of the gaming community. The weeks following release saw fans’ anticipation turn to rage when they found out a number of things shown in pre-promotion hadn’t made it into the finished game. No ringed planets! You can’t see other players even if you end up in the same star system! All its space ships feel the same to fly! After weeks of silence punctuated by the occasional bug fix, the No Man’s Sky: Foundation Update appeared last month, adding all sorts of new toys to play with. It also adds a survival mode, in which living long enough to get your spaceship off the ground is an act of luck and determination. As its name implies, the Foundation Update lays the groundwork for more complexity, giving your job as space explorer more purpose. No Man’s Sky’s universe is already a more fun and interesting place to hang out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3acd3db90a0435f7a12d0346a898158a06e4ed4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3acd3db90a0435f7a12d0346a898158a06e4ed4e/0_52_715_429/500.jpg\" alt=\"Super Mario Run.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Super Mario Run.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which leaves <strong>Super Mario Run</strong> (iOS), a title whose paramount importance to loss-making Nintendo is underlined by the fact that its production was overseen by no less than game-design guru and inventor of Mario himself, Shigeru Miyamoto. It’s also the very first time a Mario title has appeared on non-Nintendo hardware. Interacting using just one thumb, you jump your way across a series of increasingly involved levels, collecting coins and hopping on enemies’ heads. Although apparently simple, its 24 stages conceal astonishing volumes of secrets and extras to discover, and its competitive Toad Rally mode is already establishing itself as a minor classic. The downside? You can’t play without an internet or perfect 3G connection so, like a sulky child, Mario stubbornly refuses to leave the house with you; a pity given how perfectly sized his levels are for use at bus stops and on train journeys.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Walking into the KFC restaurant in Beijing’s financial district, you’d be forgiven for thinking it was a fried chicken outlet like any other. It’s only if you head right to the back corner of the shop that you realise you’re actually in China’s first smart restaurant.</p> <p>KFC has teamed up with Baidu – the search engine company often referred to as “China’s Google” – to develop facial-recognition technology that can be used to predict customer’s orders. </p> <p>Explaining the idea, a spokesperson for KFC said: “The artificial intelligence-enabled system can recommend menu items based on a customer’s estimated age and mood.” A press release from Baidu added that “a male customer in his early 20s” would be offered “a set meal of crispy chicken hamburger, roasted chicken wings and coke”, while “a female customer in her 50s” would get a recommendation of “porridge and soybean milk for breakfast”. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7203388b45a10f1cd6922cdd64dc13acaa88176\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7203388b45a10f1cd6922cdd64dc13acaa88176/32_823_2367_2958/800.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Hawkins ordering from the machine.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Hawkins ordering from the machine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Hawkins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, steeled for some patronisingly gendered suggestions of salad or maybe a small portion of chips, I headed over to try the restaurant of the future for myself. A male customer service assistant in his 20s demonstrated the machine for me, and was indeed offered a chicken hamburger set meal. I stood in position, and was read as being female (correct), beautiful (correct) and in my 30s (only a decade off). On this basis, I was also recommended a chicken hamburger meal. If you don’t agree with the suggestion, you can click through to see some alternatives. In other words, it shows you the menu, but shorter. Once you’re happy with your choice, you can pay with your mobile phone at the machine, and collect your meal moments later at the counter.</p> <p>Despite being billed as artificial intelligence, the technology is more about convenience – and publicity – at this stage of development. “The digitalisation of the restaurant will also help to provide faster and easier services,” <a href=\"http://www.eco-business.com/news/kfc-launches-first-ai-enabled-outlet-in-beijing/\">said Zhao Li</a>, general manager of Beijing KFC.</p> <p>Customers, however, seem less convinced. “It’s very interesting, but most people will choose the more familiar way,” said Dione Xiong, a 21-year-old KFC regular. She’s right – as the lunchtime throng pours in, not one person gives the machine a second or even first glance, preferring instead to wait longer in line and order from the human attendants. </p> <p>Li Jiang Wei, a middle-aged office worker, agrees to test the machine for me, and is offered a meal of chicken soup with rice: “It’s what I ate yesterday, but I didn’t like it.”</p> <p>“If it knows in future what I want to eat that’s great, but at the moment it’s not very smart.”</p> <p>KFC and Baidu hope that they will be able to know what customers will want in future. KFC has said it wants to provide “a personalised ordering experience” by “recalling repeat customers and their orders”. However, when I go back a few days later to try out the machine again, though it reads the same characteristics from my face it doesn’t remember my preferences. Instead, it offers me a variety of breakfast items, apparently tailoring my recommendations to the time of day rather than to the customer. At the breakfast rush, the machine is no busier than at lunch, most customers again preferring to order at the counter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9dd3c128abe5ed0e0e7e10bddf57909aaf3bb3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9dd3c128abe5ed0e0e7e10bddf57909aaf3bb3a/0_595_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The facial recognition machine to the left sits unused as customers queue to be served by humans instead\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The facial recognition machine to the left sits unused as customers queue to be served by humans instead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Hawkins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, the prospect of a company storing data about customers’ faces and fried-chicken preferences raises the ever present trade-off between convenience and privacy. One woman tells me she wouldn’t use the machine for that reason, but most customers are nonplussed. “In China, you don’t have any privacy anyway,” said Li.</p> <p>He’s right, sort of. Beyond the world of fast-food, personal data in China is becoming an increasingly valuable commodity. <a href=\"http://epaper.oeeee.com/epaper/A/html/2016-12/12/content_103959.htm?from=timeline&amp;isappinstalled=0&amp;winzoom=1\">A Chinese newspaper</a> recently conducted <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/04/in-china-big-brother-isnt-just-watching-your-every-move-he-may-be-selling-your-personal-data/?postshare=6851483522049062&amp;tid=ss_tw&amp;utm_term=.ab335eed29ab\">an experiment</a>, which found that a citizen’s private data, including apartments they’d rented and internet cafés they’d visited, could be bought using their personal ID number at the cost of just 700RMB (£82). Meanwhile, the government is rolling out a “<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21711902-worrying-implications-its-social-credit-project-china-invents-digital-totalitarian\">social credit</a>” system of digitally stored information about a person’s credit history, consumption habits and incidences of “conduct that seriously undermines … the normal social order”. The system also awards points for good behaviour; a person’s point score affects their ability to travel abroad, buy property and enrol their children in certain schools, among other privileges. </p> <p>It’s unlikely that a person’s lunchtime KFC order will determine whether or not they get a mortgage. KFC has stressed that the data it collects is “highly secured” and “will not be used for other purposes”. But with facial recognition technology planned to be expanded to KFC’s 5,000 stores around China, and potentially normalised into other public-facing services, it’s a glimpse into a future where nothing is private, not even your guilty eating habits.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Messaging services such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Gmail will face tough new rules on the tracking of users under a revision to the ePrivacy Directive proposed by the European Commission on Tuesday.<br /></p> <p>The new legislation seeks to reinforce the right to privacy and control of data for European citizens, with messaging, email and voice services – such as those provided by Facebook, Google and Microsoft – forced to guarantee the confidentiality of conversations and metadata around the time, place and other factors of those conversations.</p> <p>Listening to, tapping, intercepting, scanning or the storing of communications will not be allowed without the consent of the user, unless it is critical for billing or other purposes. Companies will have to ask for the explicit consent of users before being able to use their data for advertising purposes, which most use to fund services provided for free to end-users.</p> <p>Andrus Ansip, vice-president for the digital single market said: “Our proposals will deliver the trust in the Digital Single Market that people expect. I want to ensure confidentiality of electronic communications and privacy. Our draft ePrivacy Regulation strikes the right balance: it provides a high level of protection for consumers, while allowing businesses to innovate.”</p> <p>The rules governing the placing and use of cookies, which currently require consent for all purposes and has led to a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/19/cookies-how-to-avoid-being-tracked-online\">cookie warning </a>appearing on a site when visiting for the first time, are being simplified. The EC hopes to remove the overload of cookie warnings.</p> <p>Cookies required for the operation of an internet experience that do not impact on privacy, such as items in an online shopping cart, will no longer require consent, nor will cookies used to analyse visitor numbers. But “privacy intrusive” cookies will still require consent before being placed on a user’s machine.</p> <p>The proposals also ban unsolicited and nonconsensual electronic communication, and will require marketing calls to display their phone number or use a special prefix only for marketing calls.</p> <p>Companies falling foul of the new laws will face fines of up to 4% of their global turnover, in line with the separate General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) set to be applied in 2018.</p> <p>MEP and former vice-president of the European Commission, Viviane Reding, welcomed the proposal but warned that scrutiny of the exemptions regarding metadata and content was required. She said: “I salute the extension of the scope to over-the-top services such as WhatsApp, the recognition of the general principles of confidentiality and prior consent, and the many consumer safeguards regarding unsolicited direct marketing communications and spam.”</p> <p>The EC’s proposal looks to close the perceived regulation gap between traditional telecoms companies and predominantly US-based internet communications companies. It extends some of the rules governing telecoms operators to so-called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-top_content\">over-the-top</a> services, while also allowing telecom companies to use customer metadata – such as the duration and location of calls – to provide additional services and make more money, something they are barred from doing under the current rules.</p> <p>The telecoms industry said the proposals were still stricter for them than web companies. Lise Fuhr, director general of the European telecoms lobby ETNO said: “Unlike others, telcos risk being prevented from expanding consumer choice by using traffic and location data for big data analytics, Internet of Things and connected driving services.”</p> <p>Online advertisers also warned that overly strict rules would undermine the ability of many websites to fund themselves and offer free services. Yves Schwarzbart, head of policy and regulatory affairs at the Internet Advertising Bureau, said: “It will particularly hit those companies that … find it most difficult to talk directly to end users and what I mean by that is tech companies that operate in the background and facilitate the buying and selling of advertising, rather than the ones that the user directly engages with.”</p> <p>Online advertising generates £10bn ($12bn) of revenue for publishers and content creators in the UK alone, according to the IAB.</p> <p>The proposal requires approval from the European Parliament and member states before becoming law,. It is set to join the much needed update to data protection <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/14/european-parliament-approve-tougher-data-privacy-rules\">voted through under the GDPR</a>, which will apply to the UK from 25 May 2018, despite the Brexit process.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/14/european-parliament-approve-tougher-data-privacy-rules\">European parliament approves tougher data privacy rules</a><br /></strong></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/20/eu-facebook-misleading-information-whatsapp\"><strong>EU charges Facebook with giving ‘misleading’ information over WhatsApp</strong></a></li> </ul>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Turning a space into a home is a process akin to alchemy. It’s a combination of objects (old, new, inherited, broken, and sometimes of mysterious origin) and an investment of emotional energy. Space does not become a home overnight. It’s worked and kneaded, left to rise. It is gradual, and then it is a sudden realisation that becomes magically real: this house is now mine.</p> <p>Hana Lee and Tom Davison, the duo behind independent studio <a href=\"https://humblegrove.itch.io/\">Humble Grove</a>, explore this cathexis of placemaking in their forthcoming game, 29, set in an isometric facsimile of the flat they lived in as students. Via soft, desaturated pastels, they’ve captured the whole feel of the place, from a clock ticking on the wall, to a cat purring, radiators popping and pipes groaning in the walls. But there are also magical elements mixed in with the kitchen sink realism. A small fern creeps up from the floor where you walk, and it dies just as quickly. Stars wink in and out of existence just behind you. It’s a familiar place – but uncertain. There are suitcases packed in the bedroom, but nowhere to go. </p> <p>“I really like things that have a living feel to them,” says Lee. “I don’t really like seeing clean rooms in games. It’s always so nice to see, like, paper scattered everywhere. Pens on desks. Not neat at all.” It’s fairly clear, then, which desk in 29 belongs to Lee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48bd77065e77ed38d02dbe7bf862becc90cb7d9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48bd77065e77ed38d02dbe7bf862becc90cb7d9f/212_136_1488_893/1000.png\" alt=\"‘I don’t really like seeing clean rooms in games.

It’s always so nice to see, like, paper scattered everywhere. Pens on desks. Not neat at all.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Humble Grove</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The game is billed as a semi-autobiographical magical realist point-and-click adventure. Players start out controlling Tom’s character, Bo, but later inhabit different friends and residents as the narrative evolves – these characters are loosely based on the developers themselves and real-life friends, and the narrative takes in incidences and conversations from their student days; but like memory, everything has a sheen of fiction to it. Lee and Davison also view 29 as a kind of self-inventory. “It’s a way to examine yourself,” Davison says. “It’s like a ‘get to know you’ session, really. And you get to examine each other.”</p> <p>“Like when you’re doing the animations,” Davison says to Lee. “Trying to learn my mannerisms.”<br /></p> <p>“Yeah, I’m like, ‘Walk, so I can see you’!” says Lee.<br /></p> <p>Much like finding what particular movement turns their walk into precisely <em>their</em> walk, Lee and Davison’s work on 29 showcases the magical in the everyday domestic drudgery. No one balks at the love potions in the shower, or the deer skull in the toaster. At one point, your character encounters a monster in the spare room and you’re more put out by the fact that the creature misnames you, rather than the fact that there is a monster in the spare room. The exchange is perhaps a nod to experiences Davison and Lee have each had; they identify as gender neutral and so misgendering and misidentifying are things they face in real-life.<br /></p> <p>“We’ve had people asking about the pronouns, like, why are they using ‘they’? I think that’s fine if people are interested in that, but … there’s a lot more to explore,” Davison says. “It’s just a natural occurrence.”</p> <p>Lee and Davison are recently graduated, and now often separated by thousands of miles (Lee in Tokyo, Davison in London). They’re still trying to pin down a place together and 29 is part of a series of adventures under the header No Longer Home that ties this quest together. A prologue, Friary Road, is already available on the studio’s website.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b34f0bcf6ff954275b1cfaadcadcc849d0e5bd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b34f0bcf6ff954275b1cfaadcadcc849d0e5bd4/212_96_1568_941/1000.png\" alt=\"A screen shot of 29.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screen shot of 29.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Humble Grove</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In this analysis of place and emotion, they take inspiration from Cardboard Computer’s acclaimed Kentucky Route Zero, and Fullbright’s Gone Home – thoughtful examinations of how space is inhabited and imbued with meaning. Humble Grove are already a standout studio in the category of short, experiential games which have received a lot of attention this year; games like Variable State’s Virginia, or Campo Santo’s Firewatch. 29 isn’t an adventure in the traditional sense – you’re not solving puzzles by building an inventory of selected objects; it’s about investigating the space, clicking on objects, learning the stories behind them, and building a picture. For many players, who went to university themselves, or who may have shared a flat with others, the game may well invoke familiar feelings – these places are home, but also transient; they’re yours but not yours. </p> <p>Lee and Davison acknowledge their place in this new era of experimental game design, but despite the thriving community of artists and gamemakers around them, they’re still trying to find a place for themselves – they’re looking to express themselves through smaller spaces. “It’s a very claustrophobic game,” concedes Lee. Although you can go outside of the small cramped flat, your explorations are confined to the unkempt yard – you have the illusion of escape, but not the option. Both creators liken the experience of their game to a moment from the previous summer, when they first showed the project at indie festival, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/21/sex-art-camping-alternative-video-game-festival\">Feral Vector</a>, which takes place in an old church, just outside Hebden Bridge.</p> <p>“Us and a couple of other people were exploring the seating area,” says Davison. “A bit higher up there were these trap doors. There were two loose planks, and we thought, ‘Oh no, we should tell someone.’ And we lifted them, and we saw a ladder ...”</p> <p>“There were stairs going down,” continues Lee. “And it was ... I don’t know how a person could get down there. We just started making up stories about what could be at the bottom.”</p> <p>The experience stuck with them – exploring the hidden parts of a bigger place, bustling with people, trying to find a moment for themselves. It’s the sort of thinking that guides their work. When asked about the appeal of 29, about what has made people want to play it at indie events around the world, Lee thinks a while before you replying: “You can make a small space about you.”<br /></p> <p><em>29 is released on PC/Mac later in 2017</em></p>',\n",

Kuosmanen discovered that when a user attempts to fill in information in some simple text boxes, such as name and email address, the autofill system, which is intended to avoid tedious repetition of standard information such as your address, will input other profile-based information into any other text boxes – even when those boxes are not visible on the page.</p> <p>It means that when a user inputs seemingly innocent, basic information into a site, the autofill system could be giving away much more sensitive information at the same time should the user confirm the autofill. Chrome’s autofill system, which is switched on by default, stores data on email addresses, phone numbers, mailing addresses, organisations, credit card information and various other bits and pieces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/anttiviljami/status/816585860661518336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is why I don&#39;t like autofill in web forms. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/phishing?src=hash\">#phishing</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/security?src=hash\">#security</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/infosec?src=hash\">#infosec</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/mVIZD2RpJ3\">pic.twitter.com/mVIZD2RpJ3</a></p>&mdash; Viljami Kuosmanen ⭐ (@anttiviljami) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anttiviljami/status/816585860661518336\">January 4, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Kuosmanen <a href=\"https://anttiviljami.github.io/browser-autofill-phishing/\">set up a site to demonstrate the issue</a>, showing a text box for a user’s name and email address, with text boxes for address and phone number hidden from view, autofilled by Chrome.</p> <p>Mozilla’s Firefox is immune to the problem, as it does not yet have a multi-box autofill system and cannot be tricked into filling text boxes by programatic means, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dveditz/status/818610764286218240\">according to Mozilla principle security engineer Daniel Veditz</a>. A more complete autofill system is currently in development for Firefox, however.</p> <p>The phishing attack still relies on users being tricked into entering at least some information into an online form, but unsuspecting users could be tricked into entering more than they bargained for relatively easily.</p> <p>Users can protect themselves from this kind of phishing attack by disabling the autofill system within their browser or extension settings.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/28/airline-passenger-details-online-bookings-easy-prey-hackers-say-researchers\"><strong>Airline passenger details easy prey for hackers, say researchers</strong></a><br /></li> </ul>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Your medical data is for sale – all of it. Adam Tanner, a fellow at Harvard’s institute for quantitative social science and author of a new book on the topic, <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/539847/our-bodies-our-data-by-adam-tanner/9780807033340/\">Our Bodies, Our Data</a>, said that patients generally don’t know that their most personal information – what diseases they test positive for, what surgeries they have had – is the stuff of multibillion-dollar business. </p> <p>But although the data is nominally stripped of personally identifying information, data miners and brokers are working tirelessly to aggregate detailed dossiers on individual patients; the patients are merely called “24601” instead of “Jean Valjean”.</p> <p>At the doctor’s office, Tanner told the Guardian, “you close the door and you think, I’m telling my doctor my most intimate medical secrets, and only my doctor knows about it. But it’s sold commercially.” Patients are reduced to gender, age, particular ailments and neighborhood. Then, Tanner said, data miners cross-reference that information with data from pharmacies about who they sell prescriptions to, culled by big drugstore chains like Rite Aid and CVS.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/oct/23/healthcare-big-data-how-much-medical-information-would-you-share\">How much medical information would you share in the name of big data?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a <a href=\"https://tcf.org/content/report/strengthening-protection-patient-medical-data/\">new report</a> from the Century Foundation released on Tuesday, Tanner quotes Per Lofberg of CVS: “The patient is not really a component of this because their name and connection to the prescription have been stripped off.” </p> <p>But other forms of data, such as information from fitness devices and search engines, are completely unregulated and have identities and addresses attached. A third kind of data called “predictive analytics” cross-references the other two and makes predictions about behavior with what Tanner calls “a surprising degree of accuracy”.</p> <p>None of this technically violates the health insurance portability and accountability act, or Hipaa, Tanner writes. But the techniques do render the protections of Hipaa largely toothless. “Data scientists can now circumvent Hipaa’s privacy protections by making very sophisticated guesses, marrying anonymized patient dossiers with named consumer profiles available elsewhere – with a surprising degree of accuracy,” says the study.</p> <p>“The problem over time is that as you have more and more information, there’s more and more about people who might be,” Tanner said. He has lived in two different cities recently, he said; now he will teach for a year in the small city of Fairbanks, Alaska – population roughly 32,000. On an index that cross-references people who have lived at addresses in all three cities over a five-year period – an easy-to-find set of data – the researcher said he could easily be the only entry.</p> <p>Tanner said that non-medical data, which people might consider less private, is in fact easier for the owner to control. “You could try to choose your doctor based on what systems they use and whether [those systems] sell your data commercially, but often you have insurance through your employer and you don’t have a choice.”</p> <p>Many companies trade in medical data – IMS Health is the one Tanner names most prominently in the Century Foundation report, but IBM Watson and General Electric also have businesses in patient info.</p> <p>The legal right of businesses to harvest and sell the information of individual patients without their permission <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/10-779P.ZO\">has been upheld by the US supreme court</a>, thanks to a case in which conservative justices ruled in favor of IMS Health and against the attorney general of Vermont. In 2011, the high court struck down a Vermont law restricting the sale, disclosure, and use of records that revealed the prescribing practices of individual doctors, ruling that corporations’ right to free speech trumped individuals’ right to privacy.</p> <p>“We need to discuss this,” Tanner said. “[Data miners and brokers] often don’t want to talk about it because it’s a multibillion-dollar trade and they say there’s a great chance to advance medical science. They don’t talk about the real reason, which is marketing and sales.”</p> <p>The question of whether or not to use individual medical data in the interest of private corporations should be up to those individuals, Tanner concluded. “If there’s a chance to advance medical science, let them make the case to we the patients. If you want to donate your data to science, that’s great, but you should have the choice. Right now, we don’t have the choice.”</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Snap Inc, the company formerly known as Snapchat, has announced that it will set up its main international hub in the UK, in what is likely to be seen as a vote of confidence for British tech following the EU referendum result.</p> <p>The company says it chose Britain because of the nation’s “strong creative industries” in a move that bucks the trend of US tech companies favouring low-tax jurisdictions such as Luxembourg (where Amazon is based) or Ireland (where Facebook and Apple have their international headquarters).</p> <p>Claire Valoti, Snap’s UK general manager, said: “The UK is where our advertising clients are, where more than 10 million daily Snapchatters are, and where we’ve already begun to hire talent.”</p> <p>Although Britain has yet to leave the EU, or even begin the process by invoking Article 50, smaller technology companies have expressed fears over the likely effect Brexit, particularly a “<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/28/hard-brexit-would-damage-almost-every-sector-of-uk-economy\">hard Brexit</a>”, would have on the sector. However, larger firms, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/21/google-facebook-brexit-uk-technology-sector-skills\">including Facebook and Google</a>, have recently committed themselves to more investment in the country.</p> <p>The new British company is called Snap Group Limited, following its American parent’s rebranding from Snapchat to Snap Incorporated. The name is intended to focus on Snap’s new self-image as a camera company first and foremost. “We believe that reinventing the camera represents our greatest opportunity to improve the way people live and communicate,” the company tells users on its website.</p> <p>That reinvention was supported by Snap’s second ever product, a pair of glasses with a built-in Wi-Fi camera called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/24/snapchat-launches-video-capture-sunglasses-spectacles\">Spectacles</a>. The gadget, which has only been sold through custom-built vending machines temporarily installed in various locations around the US, has been a hit among fans, despite its limited availability.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Spectacles have yet to hit the rest of the world, but when they do, much of the revenue will come through the UK. A spokeswoman confirmed that Snap Group Limited will not only record revenue made in Britain, but also revenue from other countries where Snap has no local presence. The choice is deliberately intended to align Snap’s corporate structure with the firm’s business, she added.</p> <p>With a stated user base of over 150m, Snapchat is smaller than seeming competitors like Facebook and Twitter, with a billion and 350 million users respectively. But the company has focused on dominating a few particular niches over the broad-based reach of the larger firms, and is particularly popular among young people in Britain and the US. The company says more than 60% of British smartphone users aged between 13 and 34 are Snapchatters. Those numbers add up: research firm eMarketer estimates the company could pull in almost $1bn advertising revenue over 2017.</p>',\n",

Today, the company briefly suspended Alexandra Brodsky, a fellow at the National Women’s Law Center, after she retweeted screengrabs of antisemitic abuse she received. Her abusers’ accounts were not suspended.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/09/martin-shkreli-suspended-from-twitter-for-alleged-harrassment-of-lauren-duca\">Martin Shkreli suspended from Twitter for alleged harassment of Lauren Duca</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These very different cases highlight the lack of transparency in the way Twitter handles harassment. From the outside, its abuse policies appear to be applied inconsistently, with some accounts being suspended with little explanation. Critics are calling for the microblogging platform to be more accountable for its moderation decisions.</p> <p>“I’d like to see Twitter be more open about their priorities, expectations and practices,” said Stuart Geiger, an ethnographer and Berkeley postdoctoral scholar who has studied Twitter’s approach to moderating abuse. “It does seem to be haphazard.”</p> <p>Shkreli, an entrepreneur and hedge fund founder, achieved notoriety in 2015 when he acquired the drug Daraprim, used in the treatment of Aids and cancer patients, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/21/entrepreneur-defends-raise-price-daraprim-drug\">hiked the cost of a pill from $13.50 to $750</a>. He has since built a name for himself as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/feb/04/martin-shkreli-congress-daraprim-hearing-video\">rightwing provocateur</a>.</p> <p>In the last few weeks he’s turned his attention to Duca, a freelance writer, sending her direct messages asking her to be his +1 to Donald Trump’s inauguration and changing his Twitter profile picture to a doctored image that showed him sitting with Duca on a sofa. He also made his cover photo a collage of images of Duca with the caption, “For better or worse, ‘til death do us part, I love you with every single beat of my heart”, and changed his bio to refer to his “small crush on @laurenduca (hope she doesn’t find out)”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/laurenduca/status/818124094587752452\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">How is this allowed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack\">@jack</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Wof8MlYHTL\">pic.twitter.com/Wof8MlYHTL</a></p>&mdash; Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laurenduca/status/818124094587752452\">January 8, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Duca reposted the direct message and screenshots of Shkreli’s profile, calling on Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, to help. “How is this allowed, @jack,” she wrote. Later that day, Shkreli’s account was suspended with no public explanation.</p> <p>On Sunday, Duca <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidmack/martin-shkreli-suspended-from-twitter?utm_term=.tfYjnvQWE#.jsmpAXojK\">told Buzzfeed</a>: “I don’t know how this could possibly be allowed because this is an act of targeted harassment.”<br /></p> <p>The suspension of Shkreli’s account follows a similar pattern to that of Breitbart journalist Milo Yiannopoulos, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/20/milo-yiannopoulos-nero-permanently-banned-twitter\">permanently banned</a> from the platform last year for his role in the online abuse of Ghostbusters actor Leslie Jones. It wasn’t until Jones publicly quit the platform following an onslaught of racist and sexist vitriol, whipped up by Yiannopoulos, that Twitter decided to act.</p> <p>Twitter suspends accounts for a number of reasons, including abusive behaviour, sending spam or if the account has been hacked. These suspensions may be temporary or permanent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4717df6cf6c35c2772fb8c4edf5a6e15d43c6d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4717df6cf6c35c2772fb8c4edf5a6e15d43c6d0/0_147_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Leslie Jones publicly quit Twitter after a campaign of abuse by rightwing journalist Milo Yiannopoulos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Actor Leslie Jones publicly quit Twitter after a campaign of abuse by rightwing journalist Milo Yiannopoulos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to <a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311\">Twitter’s rules</a>, a user can be deemed abusive if they harass, intimidate or use fear to silence another user’s voice. This includes making threats of violence, inciting or engaging in targeted abuse of others, promoting hate against others based on race, sexual orientation, gender, age or disability, and publishing the private information of others, known as “doxxing”.</p> <p>How Twitter applies these rules, however, is less clear. The platform appears to tackle abuse in a reactive, rather than strategic, way according to how high-profile the target of abuse is. Both Yiannopoulos and Shkreli had sent messages that could be interpreted as intimidating or misogynistic before they were suspended, but Twitter only acted when they targeted users with large followings.</p> <p>In some cases, the platform blocks the victim rather than the antagonist, as happened in the case of Brodsky.</p> <p>She found her account temporarily suspended after she tweeted screenshots of antisemitic abuse she was receiving. The accounts of the people who sent the abuse remained online.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/danabolger/status/818493340224262145\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This weekend, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/azbrodsky\">@azbrodsky</a> and I got harassing anti-Semitic tweets.

At the time her account was suspended she was in the middle of a campaign <a href=\"http://knowyourix.org/wp-content/uploads/KYIX-NAESV-Testimony-Sessions-Nomination.pdf\">opposing the appointment of Jeff Sessions</a> of the role of attorney general.</p> <p>“Twitter is a cesspool, but it’s a really important useful cesspool,” she told the Guardian. “A lot of us don’t have the option of disengaging because it’s a powerful tool to get the work done.”</p> <p>These cases highlight the lack of transparency over Twitter’s decision-making, particularly as it is a key forum for public discourse and with President-elect Donald Trump now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/05/can-donald-trump-save-twitter\">even using it to announce policy changes</a>. </p> <p>“Twitter is becoming more like governments. We don’t expect them to be black boxes,” said Geiger.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/05/can-donald-trump-save-twitter\">Can Donald Trump save Twitter?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I’m a law school graduate, so I like the idea of there being public justifications for these decision,” added Brodsky. “It would be helpful to for us to see if Twitter is being consistent and whether the size of the platform of the target plays into the decision making.”</p> <p>Geiger said that abuse is particularly acute on Twitter because of the way it’s designed. “Twitter has one of the toughest jobs among the various online platforms because of its immediacy. The same stuff that happens on Facebook doesn’t get the same public reach. Twitter pushes us all together – I can tweet Donald Trump if I want to. It’s part of the thrill but also why it can be so problematic and dangerous,” he said.</p> <p>He believes Twitter might be dragging its feet over really clamping down on harassment in the way it’s clamped down on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/18/twitter-suspends-accounts-terrorism-links-isis \">terrorist accounts</a> for fear of losing too many users. Already members of the “alt-right” are moving to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/17/gab-alt-right-social-media-twitter\">Twitter alternatives like Gab</a>. </p> <p>“If you look at it from a business perspective, if they have a dip in the number of users active on the platform they’ll have a dip in stock price,” he said. “It puts them in a tricky position.”</p> <p>Twitter did not respond to questions about how exactly it decides which accounts to suspend and who is responsible for making the decisions. The company did, however, point towards a <a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/safety/enforcement\">general explainer on its review process</a>. </p>',\n",

In France, the main political parties are being advised by the security services on how to protect themselves from cyber-attack. <br /></p> <p>One senior Whitehall source with knowledge of the issue said there was a need for the security services to do more to help protect UK political parties from attack by foreign governments. “MPs from across the House of Commons who understand the nature of the cybersecurity threat and the vulnerabilities of political parties are in agreement that something needs to be done involving the security agencies. It cannot be right that other countries are taking this seriously but the UK is not,” the source said.</p> <p>In a sign of growing concern about cyber-threats, the joint committee on the UK’s national security strategy launched an inquiry into digital security on Monday, with its chair, Dame Margaret Beckett, highlighting the potential for foreign states to engage in hacking for political purposes.</p> <p>The Labour former foreign secretary said: “While the digital revolution has opened up a whole host of opportunities, it has also created new vulnerabilities. The national security implications of the leap to cyber are a matter of increasing concern. Attention has recently focused on the potential exploitation of the cyber-domain by other states and associated actors for political purposes, but this is just one source of threat that the government must address through its recently launched five-year strategy.”</p> <p>Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the National Cyber-Security Centre, part of GCHQ, has also warned that the suspected Russian hack of the US Democrats could inspire a similar attack in the UK.</p> <p>Responding to Robertson, the Cabinet Office pointed to several references in the national cyber-security strategy to protecting the UK from hacking for political purposes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/06/russian-hacker-putin-election-alisa-shevchenko\">Young Russian denies she aided election hackers: ‘I never work with douchebags’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is understood that the political parties have not automatically received help from the intelligence agencies or police about bolstering their security in light of the Democratic party email hacking, but that they could get advice, assistance and support if they approached the National Cyber-Security Centre. <br /></p> <p>Asked about precautions against the threat of attack, Labour said it was “constantly updating and reviewing” its online security, while the Liberal Democrats said they had updated some of their security processes in response to concerns about the threat of foreign hacking.

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Cybercriminals do stuff online, so punish them by taking away their internet access. It’s as simple as taking a crowbar from a burglar. Or is it? Some outside-the-box thinking by a top cop this week has triggered a debate among cybersecurity types about young offending and punishment.</p> <p>Ch Supt Gavin Thomas, the president of the Police Superintendents’ Association of England and Wales, suggested in an interview that wifi jammers – devices worn on the ankle or wrist to block the internet – could serve as a smarter punishment for cybercrimes than prison. “We have got to stop using 19th-century punishments to deal with 21st-century crimes,” <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/07/teenage-criminals-should-fitted-wifi-jammers-rather-going-prison/\">he said</a>.</p> <p>Few would dispute that, but there are some issues with jammers. First, they are <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/spectrum/radio-spectrum-and-the-law/jammers\">illegal under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006</a>, so we’d need to work on that. Second, they wouldn’t work.</p> <p>“Although we desperately need alternatives to prison, using wifi jammers is both technically infeasible and unreliable,” says Cal Leeming, who went to prison for hacking as a teenager and is now a security consultant. “Even if you did manage to implement it without breaking nearby connectivity, which in itself would be very difficult because of how radio works, it could be easily circumvented by using a cable.”</p> <p>Darren Martyn, an Irish convicted hacker turned security researcher (he was part of the LulzSec group), adds: “This would cause huge disruption to anyone within jamming range of the ‘tagged’ person.”</p> <p>Legal and technical hurdles notwithstanding, would an enforced screen break – <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/22354743\">a digital grounding of the sort increasingly issued by parents</a> – help solve the broader problem? <a href=\"http://www.maryaiken.com/\">Prof Mary Aiken</a>, a cyber-psychologist at University College Dublin, is sceptical. If the criminal justice system is struggling to keep pace with tech, the lag in education is the graver threat, she says. “It is going to be very difficult if not impossible to prosecute our way out of problems such as youth hacking,” she explains. “What is required is a fundamental re-evaluation of the impact of technology on developing youth.” </p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.mdx.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0025/245554/Pathways-White-Paper.pdf\">Youth Pathways into Cybercrime (pdf)</a>, a report published in October by Middlesex University, Aiken and her colleagues recommend not thwarting the digital skills of these young people, but giving them safer outlets.</p> <p>Jessica Barker, a cybersecurity consultant who runs the <a href=\"http://cyber.uk/\">cyber.uk</a> website, agrees. She cites research by Sonia Livingstone, who leads the <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/parenting4digitalfuture/2016/07/06/what-and-how-should-parents-be-advised-about-screen-time/\">Parenting for a Digital Future</a> research project at the London School of Economics. It suggests that denying screen time or web access can be counterproductive, whether we’re talking about naughty kids or young criminals. “Children who are blocked access are more likely to engage in risky behaviour because they will find another way to access the internet that is unsupervised,” Barker says.</p>',\n",

The problem is that when you have Alexa, the intelligent assistant that powers Amazon Echo, entering millions of homes to do the shopping, answer questions, play music, report the weather and control the thermostat, there are bound to be glitches.</p> <p>And so to Dallas, Texas, where a six-year-old girl made the mistake of asking Alexa: <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/7/14200210/amazon-alexa-tech-news-anchor-order-dollhouse\">“Can you play dollhouse with me and get me a dollhouse?”</a> Alexa promptly complied by ordering a $170 (£140) KidKraft doll’s house and, for reasons known only to the virtual assistant, four pounds of sugar cookies. The snafu snowballed when a San Diego TV station reported the story, using the “wake word” Alexa, which is the Amazon Echo equivalent of saying Candyman five times into the mirror. Several viewers called the station to complain that their own Alexa had woken up and ordered more doll’s houses in what turned into a thoroughly 21st-century comedy of consumer errors. And a bonanza day for KidKraft.</p> <p>Many of Amazon Echo’s gaffes stem from misunderstandings arising from an intelligent assistant who never sleeps (and an owner who hasn’t pin-protected their device). Last March, NPR ran a story on Amazon Echo’s capacity to extend the power of the internet into people’s homes. Again, Alexa took its power too literally and <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/amazon-s-alexa-went-bonkers-reset-user-s-thermostat-n536651\">hijacked listeners’ thermostats</a>. Another owner reported how their <a href=\"http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/12/kid-gets-amazon-echo-dot-alexa-to-play-porn.html\">child’s demand for a game called Digger Digger</a> was misheard as a request for porn.</p> <p>On Twitter, Amazon Echo owners continue to share items that unexpectedly end up on shopping lists, whether sneakily added by children or simply because Alexa misheard or picked up random background noise. One owner uploaded a video in which their Amazon Echo read back a shopping list that included <a href=\"https://qz.com/704616/amazon-echo-owners-are-finding-unexpected-items-like-big-fart-on-their-shopping-lists/\">“hunk of poo, big fart, girlfriend, [and] Dove soap”</a>. Another included “150,000 bottles of shampoo” and “sled dogs”.</p> <p>Behind all this lies the more serious question of privacy: what happens to the data collected by voice-activated devices such as Amazon Echo and Google Home, and who is able to access it? Most recently, US police investigating the case of an Arkansas man, James Bates, charged with murder, <a href=\"http://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2016/12/police-ask-alexa-did-you-witness-a-murder/\">obtained a warrant to receive data from his Amazon Echo</a>. Although Amazon refused to share information sent by the Echo to its servers, the police said a detective was able to extract data from the device itself. </p> <p>The case not only puts Alexa in the futuristic position of being a potential key witness to a murder, it also raises concerns about the impact of letting a sophisticated virtual assistant – a market estimated to be worth $3.6bn by 2020 – into our homes. As Megan Neitzel, the mother of the girl who wished for a doll’s house, put it: “I feel like whispering in the kitchen … I [now] tell my kids Alexa is a very good listener.”</p>',\n",

Like most other mirrorless models, this Olympus features an electronic viewfinder and allows access to a range of interchangeable lenses (although not as large a selection as some DSLRs).</p> <p>Bulk is also shed by the use of a micro four-thirds sensor, which is smaller than the types typically found in DSLRs and some compacts. The decline in image quality this creates is unlikely to be noticeable to most users – especially if they are viewing their images on screen.</p> <p>For upping your Instagram game, this is perhaps one of the best of the cameras tested. It comes with a range of on-board artistic features, including effects and filters, so you can have your photos instantly Instagram-ready. Seasoned DSLR users shouldn’t be put off – this camera is also good for some street photography or as a lightweight model for travel and holidays.</p> <p><strong>Who is it for?</strong> Those who find a smartphone limiting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fcd10d54c7516c087aa221b229d3bafa2bb50f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fcd10d54c7516c087aa221b229d3bafa2bb50f4/1013_740_3986_2392/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canon EOS 80D\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Full-featured: the Canon EOS 80D.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Canon EOS 80D</strong><br /></h2> <p><strong>and EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM; 24MP; 1245g; £1,219</strong></p> <p>This is a serious camera for enthusiasts. If you’re a point-and-shoot user wanting to upgrade, it’s a leap forward or if you’ve cut your teeth on a more basic DSLR, this is a fantastic next step.</p> <p>The 80D is a 24 megapixel, APS-C sensor camera, which should produce high enough quality images for most needs. It’s not cheap, but is packed with features that allow you to get creative and is compatible with an enormous range of lenses and other accessories.</p> <p>It has a vari-angle touch screen permitting interesting viewpoints or to get the framing and angles just right when taking a selfie. Menus and other controls, such as focus and shutter activation, can all be accessed on screen as well as the manual buttons and dials. It’s a very robust body, weather-sealed. If you’re looking for a capable DSLR and are serious about photography this is a worthy option.</p> <p><strong>Who is it for? </strong>Photographers who dream of exhibiting their work in a gallery rather than social media.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e534c682ca1a940f31270a6fe627b126544df7cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e534c682ca1a940f31270a6fe627b126544df7cd/1753_1325_2164_1298/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the Sony RX100 IV\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Packing a punch: the Sony RX100 IV.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Sony RX100 IV</strong><br /></h2> <p><strong>24-70mm equivalent; 20.1MP; 295g; £749</strong></p> <p>Sony has been producing the RX100 for almost five years and this version should benefit from a price reduction after the recent introduction of the mark V, although it remains an expensive compact.</p> <p>The RX100 IV packs a lot of punch for its size, providing high-quality images and weighing just under 300g. It has a 20 megapixel camera, with a 1in sensor and benefits from a flexible LCD screen for selfies or high- or low-angle shots. Combine that with the effects palette that comes on board most cameras these days and it’s a hard option to beat for specifications. However, for uploading photos to social media this is an expensive choice – sticking with your smartphone or point and shoot might be the option.</p> <p><strong>Who is it for? </strong> Photographers who are moving beyond Instagram.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11cf8dfd7b1db0ba78ac533825d60246c9352273\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11cf8dfd7b1db0ba78ac533825d60246c9352273/1726_1254_2191_1314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the Leica D\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An ergonomic delight: the Leica D.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Leica D-Lux</strong><br /></h2> <p><strong>Lux 24-75mm equivalent; 12.8MP; 405g; £850 </strong></p> <p>There is something satisfying about holding this chunky compact – whether it’s the solid metal body, giving heft, or perhaps it’s nostalgia for what feels like a simpler build, with dials for aperture and shutter speed.</p> <p>But this is far from basic. It is a rather high-end compact, given the price, with its 13 megapixel, four-thirds sensor, LCD screen and electronic viewfinder. And red dot. And that’s the thing. The red <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/aug/24/why-i-love-my-leica-john-naughton-photography-camera-technology-cartier-bresson\" title=\"\">Leica</a> dot imbues the camera with a certain photographic legacy. Yes, it will provide great quality images (that legacy is justified), but it’s an expensive upgrade from a smartphone.</p> <p>Ergonomically it’s a delight. The dial-based controls reminded me of using a manual film camera from what now seems like another era, even if it was just the turn of the century. It comes with a number of creative photo filter modes, ideal for social media uploads without having to spend too much time editing or processing the images.</p> <p><strong>Who is it for? </strong>For those who value the look of gear as much as their work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0447f94ad4e5fa59ce44a61bf928518bfe5f161c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0447f94ad4e5fa59ce44a61bf928518bfe5f161c/1585_1255_2009_1206/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Panasonic Lumix TZ80\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Perfect next step from a smartphone: the Panasonic Lumix TZ80.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Panasonic Lumix TZ80</strong><br /></h2> <p><strong>24mm-720mm equivalent; 18.1MP; 282g; £329</strong></p> <p>If you’re looking for an all-purpose camera, the TZ80 is a solid choice. For a compact, it’s got a massive x30 optical zoom, which means you can get up close and personal (though at the farther end things do get a bit fuzzy).</p> <p>It’s an 18megapixel camera, although with a smaller sensor (1/2.3in) than other models featured here. It comes with 22 creative options, so if you want to make your photos look miniaturised (or tilt-shifted), retro or add a star effect, you can do it all in-camera before uploading Instagram. It also has post focus that allows you to change the focal point of an image after you’ve taken it, so if anyone is photo-bombing your selfie you can blur them out.

It also has SnapBridge, which connects the camera to a smartphone via bluetooth to transmit your photos as you take them to your phone. A nice feature for those who want to quickly upload their latest image to social media.</p> <p>The D3400’s advantage over similarly priced compact and mirrorless cameras is the huge range of Nikon lenses and accessories available for expanding what is a great starter DSLR.</p> <p><strong>Who is it for?</strong> Photographers who want to experiment with different lenses and lighting effects.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia University. His specialities include competition, copyright and telecommunications law. So far, so conventional. But Wu is an unconventional academic. For one thing, he ran for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governorship of New York (and won 40% of the popular vote, though not the primary election). For another, he served for a time in the office of New York’s attorney general, specialising in issues involving technology, consumer protection and ensuring fair competition among online companies. “If I have a life mission,” he said once, “it is to fight bullies. I like standing up for the little guy and I think that’s what the state attorney general’s office does.”</p> <p>As I said, no ordinary academic. But it gets better. Wu is also the guy who coined the phrase “net neutrality”, which has turned out to be a key concept in debates about regulation of the internet. He was for a time a senior adviser to the Federal Trade Commission, America’s main consumer protection agency. And somehow, in the middle of all this activity, he writes books that make a big impact.</p> <p>In 2010, for example, he published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/02/master-switch-tim-wu-review\"><em>The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires</em></a>, a sobering history of the great communications technologies of the 20th century – the telephone, movies, broadcast radio and television. In telling the history, Wu perceived a recurring cycle in the evolution of these technologies. Each started out as open, chaotic, diverse and intensely creative; each stimulated utopian visions of the future, but in the end they all wound up “captured” by industrial interests.</p> <p>The cue for his new book, <em>The Attention Merchants</em>, is an observation the Nobel prize-winning economist Herbert Simon made in 1971. “In an information-rich world,” Simon wrote, “the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.”</p> <p>Wu’s book is a history of the attention industry, that is to say the enterprises that harvest human attention and sell it to advertisers. This is not quite the same thing as a history of <em>advertising</em>, which is a more ancient business. His story begins therefore not with the paid advertisements that featured in early newspapers and printed pamphlets, but with two separate developments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9239c85c16fab494bda08cb7b0169ad286e34da2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9239c85c16fab494bda08cb7b0169ad286e34da2/495_617_4131_2479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Wu looks back at attempts by entrepreneurs to capture the public imagination.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Wu looks back at attempts by entrepreneurs to capture the public imagination.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Groll/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first was Benjamin Day’s scandal sheet, the New York <em>Sun</em>, the first issue of which appeared on 3 September, 1833. Day’s big idea was to build circulation fast with sensational content (including what we would now call “fake news”) and a very low cover price. In the process, he established the attention merchant’s basic modus operandi: “draw attention with apparently free stuff and then resell it”, a business model that is still alive and prospering on the contemporary internet.</p> <p>The second development appeared in, of all places, 1860s Paris, in the form of huge, wall-mounted posters portraying beautiful, half-dressed women cavorting over fields of vibrant colour. They were the brainchild of <a href=\"http://artnouveauposters.biz/jules-cheret-posters\">Jules Chéret</a>, an aspiring artist and former printer, who understood that there are few better ways of gaining male attention than by displaying images of the barely clothed female form. Thus was the billboard ad born.</p> <p><em>The Attention Merchants</em> chronicles the attempts that publishers and entrepreneurs have made to capture and resell human attention over nearly two centuries, from Day in 1833 to BuzzFeed, Instagram, Google and Facebook today, with a major detour into state propaganda (Britain during the first world war, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/17/goebbels-man-behind-nazi-myth-peter-longerich-review\">Goebbels</a> during the second) along the way.</p> <p>In large measure, this is a story of communication technologies, starting with print, moving on to broadcast media (radio, television) and winding up with the internet and the technologies it has spawned (email, blogging, search engines, social media). But the striking feature of the book is the way it interweaves this story of technological development with two other strands. The first is an account of how the human subjects whose attention is being sought eventually rebel, giving rise to outbreaks of resistance that sometimes lead to regulatory intervention, but more often to changes of tack by the attention merchants. The second strand is a series of meditations on the cultural implications of the attention merchants’ success.</p> <p>As in his previous book, Wu identifies periodic cycles in the evolution of an industry for which nothing succeeds like excess – at least for a time. As Google’s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, once put it in an uncharacteristically unguarded moment: “The ideal is to get right up to the creepy line and not cross it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"68ce0103567ed41184bebc53c7aa6fdbefcbf8c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68ce0103567ed41184bebc53c7aa6fdbefcbf8c1/0_128_2500_3124/800.jpg\" alt=\"Attention seeker: Joseph Goebbels, minister of propaganda in Nazi Germany.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Attention seeker: Joseph Goebbels, minister of propaganda in Nazi Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Periodically, though, the line has been crossed. Day’s sensationalist approach, for example, generated an epidemic of patent-medicine fraud (there really was something called snake oil), until it was eventually unhorsed by crusading journalists and scientific research. In the 1950s, American television networks overdosed on quiz shows until revelations that all of the big ones were fixed. And in our own time, the ubiquity of intrusive smartphone ads has led to the ad-blocking revolt that currently threatens to undermine the basic business model of cyberspace.</p> <p>What is even more sobering, though, is the direction of travel of the long journey on which the industry has taken our culture. In the US, radio brought advertising into people’s homes in a compelling way, especially after the invention of the soap opera. (The situation was different in the UK, because of the BBC.) Then television arrived, adding the mesmeric power of images and in due course created the “primetime moment” that Goebbels craved, a moment when the entire nation’s attention was transfixed on a single broadcast event. Not for nothing were the 1950s a decade of stultifying complacency.</p> <p>Timothy Leary and the counterculture movement tried to break the hypnotic stranglehold of network TV, but in fact what really killed it was the fragmentation of the national audience with the arrival of cable TV and, later, the internet. Thus did we go from an era of mass audiences in which we were all treated as members of an undifferentiated whole to an age when personalisation technology enables Facebook and Google to profit from ads aimed – allegedly precisely – at a single individual.</p> <p><em>The Attention Merchants</em> is a sobering and significant book that takes the long view of technology and in the process escapes the “sociology of the last five minutes” that characterises so much discourse about the subject. Much of what we have to grapple with today is genuinely new. But there also appear to be some eternal verities. One is that there is no such thing as a free lunch. The other is that HL Mencken was right when he observed that no one ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the “great masses of the plain people”. Amen.</p> <h2>Q&amp;A with Tim Wu</h2> <p><strong>In <em>The Master Switch</em>, you found that the great communication technologies of the 20th century all went through a cycle: each started out open, chaotic, creative and exciting, but each eventually wound up being controlled by industrial interests. At the end of the book, you said that the great question for the internet was whether the same fate would befall it. My reading of <em>The Attention Merchants</em> is that you now have the answer and it’s yes. Have I got that right?</strong><br />Yep. I had hoped that the historic cycle could be broken, but the power of fate or economics or whatever has proved irresistible. Everyone thought the web, in particular, would remain more competitive. Yet, as Lenin put it, quantity has a quality all of its own and the last 10 years have seen the emergence of a class of superpowers driven by old-school scale economics – especially Facebook, Google and Amazon – who have gained control over their respective domains and seem unlikely to be dislodged soon. Generally, as you gaze out across the main internet ecosystem, you see less of a competitive marketplace than a succession of globally dominant firms as far as the eye can see, followed by a tired group of companies fighting over the few crumbs left over.</p> <p><strong>I describe myself as a “recovering utopian” because I once subscribed to the techno-utopian vision of the internet’s potential. How about you? Were you an idealist too?</strong><br />As George Carlin said: “Scratch any cynic and you will find a disappointed idealist.” Guilty as charged: I was an idealist and remain one, well, sort of. There was a hard, if old lesson in the fate of the web, namely, that to preserve anything public spirited takes more than good vibes – it requires some really hard-line institutional structure to maintain spaces that bring out the best in us.</p> <p>Looking back at the 00s, the great mistake of the web’s idealists was a near-total failure to create institutions designed to preserve that which was good about the web (its openness, its room for a diversity of voices and its earnest amateurism), and to ward off that which was bad (the trolling, the clickbait, the demands of excessive and intrusive advertising, the security breaches). There was too much faith that everything would take care of itself – that “netizens” were different, that the culture of the web was intrinsically better. Unfortunately, that excessive faith in web culture left a void, one that became filled by the lowest forms of human conduct and the basest norms of commerce. It really was just like the classic story of the party that went sour.</p> <p>The lesson should have been obvious, if you consider important public-spirited institutions like public parks, universities, museums, charities, some parts of the media. None of the best of these maintains a public character by just assuming people will be good or by adopting not-for-profit business models and assuming, arrogantly, that they’d be different somehow. The exception that proves the point is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/15/wikipedia-fund-future\">Wikipedia</a>, which did commit itself to a structured non-profit path. Today, I think Wikipedia can hold its head high: it has thrived without advertising or other commercial distortions, while attracting and handling more traffic than nearly any other site on Earth.</p> <p>Unfortunately, most of the rest, despite plenty of California idealism, either just allowed themselves to self-destruct or just accepted a standard corporate form with its unrelenting demands for constant revenue growth. In so doing, they shed much of their potential to be the kind of truly remarkable institutions that their founders might have wanted.</p> <p>In some ways, the history of early 00s web idealism reminds me a little of the history of the counterculture of the 1960s. Both clearly had a major cultural impact in their times. But both were overconfident in believing that they’d overcome some of humanity’s worst tendencies. Over the long term, however, it was only those who managed to create some kind of structure to preserve what they believed in that had any lasting impact. <br /></p> <p><strong>In chronicling the history of advertising you also discern cycles: a new medium appears, entrepreneurs find ways of using it to capture people’s attention that they then sell to advertisers; the advertising becomes increasingly intrusive and objectionable; eventually there’s a revolt or pushback. At the moment, you see mobile ad-blocking and the success of Netflix-type immersive content as signs of the latest revolt. But you also clearly believe that the cycle will continue. What drives this process?</strong><br />Simply put: the profit motive. Industries, unlike organisms, have no organic limits on their own growth; they are constantly in search of new markets or of new ways to exploit old ones more effectively. Having found a way to make money, a firm will persist trying to make more, even to the point of self-destruction. If the business model is advertising, that means squeezing in ever more ads that are increasingly intrusive and thereby making the product worse. In a normal market, a firm starts to realise that it has set its price too high when people stop buying and they back off. But with an advertising model, there is a delayed reaction – and then a revolt. One day people start to say: “I’ve had it, I quit.”</p> <p><strong>There’s a clear direction of travel in your history of advertising – towards more and more intrusion, culminating with the smartphone as the Trojan horse in everyone’s pocket. And you ask a plaintive rhetorical question: “Do we draw any lines between the private and the commercial?” Given where we are now, <em>could</em> we draw such a line? And how would we go about it?</strong><br />When President Obama threw parties at the White House, his guests were required to check their phones and other devices at the door. So it was a party – and with no selfies, no tweeting – where everyone’s really at the party.</p> <p>Obama’s example shows how you do it: by reclaiming physical spaces and making them non-commercial. The easiest place to do this is your home. You might have a policy of checking devices at the door, say, or confining their usage to one room in the house. However you do it, the real key is drawing physical lines, not mental lines, in recognition of just how weak our wills truly are. For you will not win trying to fight a running battle with the forces of commerce. You’ll end up like the alcoholic who goes to bars and says to himself: “I’ll be fine with just one drink.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/ive-left-twitter-unusable-anyone-but-trolls-robots-dictators-lindy-west\">I’ve left Twitter. It is unusable for anyone but trolls, robots and dictators | Lindy West</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>One of the themes in the story you tell is fragmentation and atomisation: it takes us from mass media/society to the individual locked in his/her own tech bubble. You also have, at one point, a neat throwaway line: “Technology always embodies ideology.” Do you see a connection in this evolutionary story between information technology and neoliberalism?</strong><br />The internet clearly embodied an ideological reaction to the mass media’s collectivist and nationalist ideology – particularly in broadcasting, whether it was the power of American and British national broadcasting or the propaganda media of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Overtly or implicitly, the goal of national broadcasting was always the fusing of the nation into a more unified whole. The American networks NBC and CBS saw “unifying the nation” as among their goals (conveniently, that also maximised advertising revenue). More darkly, Joseph Goebbels saw the point of broadcasting as achieving <em>Volksgemeinschaft</em>, the people’s community, the elevation of the nation over the individual.</p> <p>The internet was a reaction to these impulses. Invented in the 70s and 80s, it embodied a mixture of the countercultural and the libertarian instincts and with it brought the attractions and dangers of both. But it is a bit more complicated than that, I think, because the web, in particular, always served to elevate not just individuals, but subcultures and groups over the great undifferentiated whole. I think this helps account for a broader fragmentation not just along individual lines, but cultural and political lines as well. While once upon a time one nation tended to consist of a dominant culture and various subcultures, nowadays there is sometimes no real centre, no mainstream left, just a collection of powerful subgroups that command deep allegiances.</p> <p>Whether that’s better or worse than the old conformist media I leave to the reader to decide. Personally, I think it is much better when it comes to culture, but can be absolutely terrible when it comes to politics.</p> <p><em>• The Attention Merchants</em> by Tim Wu is published by Atlantic (£20).

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>The snow surprised us when we woke up in the hills above Ullswater. We weren’t very well prepared. With waterproof booties back in Manchester, bread bags had to double as shoeliners, one of us was missing a winter glove and only I had the slightly creepy luxury of a balaclava under my helmet.</p> <p>At least I had the right bike. Though it’s set up for off-road cyclocross racing – the flattened top tube makes the carbon frame easier to lug over obstacles – the <a href=\"http://www.dolan-bikes.com/dolan-cdx-shimano-105-5800-carbon-cyclo-cross-bike.html\">Dolan CDX</a> lends itself to winter adventuring. Designed in Ormskirk by ex-pro Terry Dolan, who once made bikes for Olympic gold medallist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/mar/31/chris-boardman-when-i-got-into-cycling-i-was-something-of-a-weirdo\">Chris Boardman</a>, Dolans are known for being tough and reliable, like a Le Creuset casserole dish. The CDX isn’t afraid of a snowstorm, nor the sleet and sunshine that followed us as we rounded the rainbow-framed lake to buy beer and milk at Pooley Bridge. I was glad of the knobbly Continental tyres when we made our way gingerly down the hill from our holiday cottage. There was all sorts of debris in the road and if I’d been on my usual slicks I’d have ended up in the hawthorn waking up hibernating hedgehogs. The older I get, the more I prefer climbing to descending. I’m rarely more scared than when rattling downhill in midwinter, when most of the snow has turned to grubby mush but you can’t rule out black ice. I’m not sure I’d have dared if the CDX didn’t have disc brakes. Rim brakes are about as practical in the wet as suede boots in a Mancunian winter (autumn, spring, summer).</p> <p>The gearing was perfectly adequate for the return leg. The compact Shimano 105 groupset comes with a big 28 sprocket on the back, so while the 20% climb back up from Ullswater through Watermillock was hardly a breeze, at least I didn’t have to get off. It is a long slog in a blizzard, but as I rounded the final corner the skies cleared to a brilliant blue and the Lake District hills dazzled under their white blanket. It was a view of such beauty that the pain of the previous 15 minutes was erased, and I stopped cursing Warburtons for making such inefficient shoeliners.</p> <p>My only real complaint about the Dolan is the sizing. At 5ft 4in, I am an inch taller than the average British woman, according to the Office for National Statistics. Even if that stat is skewed by shrinking older ladies, it doesn’t seem fair that the smallest CDX frame (52cm) is too big for me. Cyclocross, like all forms of bike racing, is still dominated by men, but don’t Dolan want women to buy their cross bikes?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a77e5f068b5a27a14929ea7b132a0ab39dcd15c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a77e5f068b5a27a14929ea7b132a0ab39dcd15c9/0_0_3296_5472/602.jpg\" alt=\"Dolan CDX Shimano 105 5800 carbon cyclocross bike\" width=\"602\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Dolan CDX Shimano 105 5800 carbon cyclocross: in numbers</h2> <p><strong>Price </strong>£1,199.99<br /><strong>Fork and seatpost</strong> Dolan carbon <br /><strong>Groupset</strong> Shimano 105 5800<br /><strong>Disc brakes</strong> Avid BB7 – 140mm rotor<br /><strong>Wheels</strong> Mavic Aksium One Disc<br /><strong>Tyres</strong> Continental cyclocross 35mm</p>',\n",

No globe-spanning journey here, just a visit to sweltering Louisiana in search of your missing spouse. There, you’ll meet the Baker family, a hick dynasty that could have stepped straight from a Truman Capote investigation. Expect mannequin fingers stuffed in drawers, filthy crows packed in microwaves and, if you’re playing the game in virtual reality, restless nights thereafter.<br />• 24 January.</p> <h2>Yakuza 0</h2> <p>Sega’s grim Japanese mob-thrillers may not have the finesse of Rockstar’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/grand-theft-auto\">Grand Theft Auto</a> series, but they offer a vivid experience of a criminal class. This, the most ambitious game in the series to date, is set in the late 1980s, within a fictionalised recreation of Tokyo’s Kabukicho and Osaka’s Dotonbori districts, seedy streets where yakuza factions vie for power. Expect bloody street fights, clumpy dialogue and an unforgettable trip to a vanished Japan. <br />• 24 January.</p> <h2>Halo Wars 2</h2> <p>Ensemble, the developer of the first Halo Wars, a real-time strategy game set in the pink and purple world of Microsoft’s tin-suited space marine, disbanded in 2009. For this unexpected sequel, control has been handed to 343 Studios, current custodians of the Xbox mascot. The game plays nothing like the twitchy shooter from which it takes its name, instead casting you as a divine overseer, moving units around the battlefield like a commander leering over a map. The tension and stakes are no less immediate for the change in perspective.<br />• 21 February.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e213f9c9b91a791b111d0d1bc77bbc5f862bf9b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e213f9c9b91a791b111d0d1bc77bbc5f862bf9b9/421_155_3128_1877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nudging the paradigm? … the Nintendo Switch console.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nudging the paradigm? … the Nintendo Switch console.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/21/nintendo-switch-new-portable-console-wii-u\">Nintendo Switch</a></h2> <p>Nintendo has been coy about this, its much anticipated new console. While Sony and Microsoft compete for technological dominance, the ancient Japanese company has, since the staggeringly popular Wii, pursued its own path with idiosyncratic designs that facilitate new kinds of play. The Switch is no different, a hybrid machine that can be used both in the home and on the road via its tablet-like screen. It’s another high-risk commercial gamble for the company but one that could potentially nudge the paradigm. <br />• March. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/07/switch-2017-nintendo-new-portable-platform\">Read our feature on Nintendo’s Switch gamble</a></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-zero-dawn-ps4/\">Horizon Zero Dawn</a></h2> <p>With the globe-spanning popularity of HBO’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/westworld\">Westworld</a>, vast pastoral parks filled with robots are undeniably in vogue. Fortuitous timing for Horizon Zero Dawn’s Dutch developer, Guerrilla Games: its forthcoming release casts you as Aloy, a primeval hunter-gatherer touring a postapocalyptic land ruled by robotic dinosaurs. Early footage indicates a visual masterpiece. Hopefully, the seemingly inventive, freeform gameplay, which allows Aloy to rewire the monsters to work in her service, will match the technical splendour.<br />• 1 March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f8d0fe5f3e7655389f9f3d6f80e65e5a2b2cb3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f8d0fe5f3e7655389f9f3d6f80e65e5a2b2cb3d/119_45_1415_849/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Battleground Bolivia … Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Battleground Bolivia … Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ubisoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/16/e3-2015-ghost-recon-wildlands-ubisoft-largest-open-world-game\">Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands</a></h2> <p>Clancy may be gone, but his khaki-coloured legacies live on in pixel. This, the first major entry in the series for years, is also the first to move to an open-world format, where missions are picked up on the ground rather than issued via separate, novelistic chapters. The setting is Bolivia, where your special operations unit is dispatched to undermine the increasingly powerful drug cartels. The development team spent months shadowing the Bolivian army, promising a nuanced and authentic depiction.<br />• 7 March</p> <h2>Nier: Automata</h2> <p>Developed by Platinum Games, the most successful action-game maker working in Japan, and directed by Atsushi Inaba, whose credits include Bayonetta, Vanquish and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, Nier: Automata is an unlikely sequel to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/apr/26/nier-xbox-ps3-game-review\">one of the Xbox’s most curious role-playing games</a>. Again, the theme is humans v robots (a defining theme of contemporary fiction that surely reveals our technological anxieties), although this time the solution is bluntly expressed via swordplay.<br />• 10 March.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/16/shenmue-3-kickstarter-crowdfunding-hits-target\">Shenmue 3</a></h2> <p>There’s no release date for Shenmue 3, the third, long awaited and highly anticipated release in Yu Suzuki’s much loved Japanese coming-of-age saga. But fans have learned to remain hopeful. Whether Sony’s reportedly meagre investment in the game (bolstered by $6m in crowdfunding donations) will be enough to deliver a game that matches the current titans of the genre is unlikely. At least Shenmue 3 will be a fascinating case study in the wisdom of resurrecting ageing, beloved stories. <br />• Release TBC<br /></p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>“Never underestimate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nintendo\">Nintendo</a>,” runs the maxim, repeated by many a rival video game executive across the decades. By 1991 the company, founded in 1889 to manufacture playing cards, had replaced Toyota as Japan’s most successful company, earning around $1.5m per year per employee. In the early 90s, its earnings exceeded that of all the US movie studios combined. That success filled a war chest on which the company has relied in leaner times – which recently have been frequent. </p> <p>Nintendo has struggled to match the boisterous success of the Wii console, as well as with its identity as a game-maker. In December, after years of equivocation, it finally sent its Super Mario mascot on to the iPhone (a debut that Nintendo resisted for years. “If we did this,” the company’s late president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/14/satoru-iwata\">Satoru Iwata</a> said in 2011, “Nintendo would cease to be Nintendo.”). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"810d3a84ac52b1c6b635d7050ca11bd9fe981a13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/810d3a84ac52b1c6b635d7050ca11bd9fe981a13/0_151_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Super Mario Run, the mobile phone offering of Nintendo’s mascot game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Super Mario Run, the mobile phone offering of Nintendo’s mascot game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/29/nintendo-handheld-gaming-sony-playstation-vita\">Why only Nintendo understands handheld gaming</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite criticism over its comparatively high price for a mobile phone game (£9.99), Super Mario Run was downloaded 40m times in four days, and earned a reported $21m. The result will go some way to countering Nintendo’s miserable financial results in early 2016. Poor sales of the disastrously named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/wii-u\">Wii U</a> (which implied the console was a minor upgrade, or, worse, a U-turn, rather than a new machine) led to an operating loss of ¥5.13bn (£36m) up until June.</p> <p>All of that, Nintendo hopes, will change in 2017. Scheduled for launch in the spring, the Nintendo Switch is the company’s bid for that hypervalued patch of real estate beneath the television. It is an invention rather than a evolution: a hybrid portable console that people will be able to play on their TV before packing the system’s tablet-like extra screen into a bag to continue playing on the bus. With the Switch, Nintendo has chosen, once again, the road less travelled. While Sony and Microsoft chase technological supremacy with PlayStation and Xbox One, Nintendo has favoured a fidgety design conceit. <br /></p> <p>It’s a machine that seeks to fit the structure of our contemporary lives, erasing the lines between home and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/29/nintendo-handheld-gaming-sony-playstation-vita\">handheld gaming</a>. The latter is an area where Nintendo has particularly lost market share to mobile phones (it’s far more convenient for a parent to pass their iPhone to a fussing child in the back seat of the car than to dig out a DS). With the company’s usual defiance, Nintendo is even turning away from the optical discs typically used for games, plumping instead for cartridges, as used by video game machines throughout the 80s and early 90s.<br /></p> <p>The past decade has shown that, no matter how ingenious its designs, Nintendo struggles to succeed alone. As soon as other game-makers abandon one of the company’s consoles – as they did en masse early into the Wii U’s life – the machine’s prospects wither. This is where the Switch is most vulnerable. It’s unlikely that third-party publishers will flock to the console with its idiosyncratic specs and demographic. It is likely it will be too expensive for others to tailor their games to.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e843f092990e2a4740e5f8ccc8d55545a3aadd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e843f092990e2a4740e5f8ccc8d55545a3aadd4/0_0_3828_2404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Visitors to the E3 expo in 2012 dance to a Wii Fit U game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"628\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visitors to the E3 expo in 2012 dance to a Wii Fit U game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David McNew/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Nintendo is not so much an industry competitoras a cohabiter. Nintendo will never try to compete with Microsoft and Sony in the traditional console market as it doesn’t have operating systems, online stores or content portfolios to sell in the same way. It could never take bites out of Sony and Microsoft’s market share, and knows it would lose the technological arms race if it tried. </p> <p>Nintendo’s more gimmicky approach springs from the company’s winding history as a toy-maker. This kind of mad inventor-like attitude accounts for hits and misses. And while the Wii U was a colossal fail, the Wii and DS handhelds were hits. Switch is a curious proposition that may struggle to find a place for itself, squeezed as it is by consoles and tablets. But it stands out from the identikit crowd (try explaining the difference between a PlayStation 4 and an Xbox One in two sentences), something wild and unexpected. </p> <p>Iwata was Nintendo’s best-loved president and started at the company as a junior programmer. His fingerprints are all over the Switch. “If we continue down the same path as we have in the past,” he once said, “people may become tired of gaming.”</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>I’ve been an Apple user for over a decade, ever since I picked up a refurbished 17in PowerBook back in 2005 to replace my ailing Windows XP box. But last month, after Apple announced its most expensive new MacBook Pros in almost 15 years, I reconsidered my decision for the first time and, for the past few weeks, I’ve been back on a Windows PC.</p> <p>I wasn’t always a Mac user. My first three computers were PCs, although the house I grew up in had an ailing, hated Power Mac Performa. My reasons for switching in my teens were fairly simple: I’d been playing fewer and fewer PC games, and spending increasing amounts of time using my computer to manage the music library linked to my iPod. I was one of those switchers, surprised by the elegance of Apple’s music player and convinced to take the plunge into their full desktop operating system.</p> <p>The laptop wasn’t cheap, but it made shuttling between my separated parents’ houses much easier. And while I missed being able to play the full library of PC games I’d built up over the years, it was an exciting time to be moving to the Mac OS world. Plus, World of Warcraft was cross-platform, which was all the gaming I needed for a good while.</p> <p>Ten years on, I’m a fairly default Apple user. I’m on my sixth iPhone, second iPad and third Mac; I have an Apple TV at home, Apple branded keyboard on my desktop, and even an Apple AA battery charger, from the days when they made them.</p> <p>But the twin punches of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/brexit-apple-mac-customers-prices-rise-us-dollar-pound-sterling\">Brexit-led depreciation of the pound</a>, and Apple releasing a new range of MacBook Pros with the least bang-for-your-buck in recent memory, made me think twice. The cheapest Mac that would be sufficient for my needs, a 13in MacBook Pro with 512GB of storage space and 16GB of ram, comes in at well over £2,000, yet is barely more powerful than the machine it’s replacing, a 15in retina MacBook Pro from four years ago that cost just over £1,500 at the time. </p> <p>So I switched back. For the past month, I’ve been using the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/25/microsoft-surface-book-review-best-windows-laptop-detachable-screen\">Surface Book</a>, the top-of-the-line laptop sold by, of all people, Microsoft.</p> <p>It’s been an experience.</p> <h2>Great-ish expectations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9eea7ed95132b842a74c21a14b641907a1d29963\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9eea7ed95132b842a74c21a14b641907a1d29963/0_0_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft Surface Book\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Microsoft Surface Book</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My expectations going in were uncertain. I know Windows has evolved radically since I last used it, back in the XP era, and has even changed since the last time I used it in anger, shortly after the launch of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2013/dec/06/windows-windows-8\">Windows 8.1</a>. The current latest version of the operating system, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2016/may/26/10-quick-questions-about-installing-windows-10-and-how-to-block-it\">Windows 10</a> (confusingly, only one version later than 8.1; the story goes that too many developers wrote code referring to Windows 95 and 98 as “9*”, meaning an actual Windows 9 would break compatibility), is generally considered a good thing. It meshes the new Windows experience of version 8 with an old-style desktop more elegantly than previous versions, while consigning ever more of the cruft deep into nested menus and offering a slick experience for first-time users.</p> <p>I was also given hope by the machine. After an awkward start with the first version of the Surface back in 2012, then pitched as an iPad competitor, Microsoft has become one of the best manufacturers of Windows PCs there is. The Surface Book is a delicious machine, masquerading as a MacBook Pro-class laptop but with a fully detachable touchscreen that opens it up to a whole new range of uses.</p> <p>The quality of the Surface machines has caused problems when it comes to Microsoft’s relationships with its hardware partners, who tended to expect Microsoft to be content raking in millions with the licensing fees for Windows, rather than competing with them directly for profit from hardware manufacturing. But for now, the company has been content to sit on the edge of the market, making niche devices for the power user.</p> <p>Despite all of that, I had a fair amount of trepidation. Memories of blue screens of death, of driver conflicts, of cleaning out my registry and restoring the system after a malware infection, are hard to shake, as is the general hangover from my youth of Microsoft as the Great Satan of the tech world. As Zuckerberg is to the 2010s, Gates was to the 1990s: ever-present, professionally amoral, and incredibly, unflappably, successful.</p> <p>But Gates is gone, as is Ballmer. This is Satya Nadella’s company now, and the Microsoft of this generation is everything the Microsoft of the 90s – or the Facebook of today – isn’t: humble, quiet, content with success where it can win and partnerships where it can’t, and as proud of working with competitors as Gates was of crushing them. In short, it’s a Microsoft that I could consider being friends with. It couldn’t be that bad.</p> <h2>Switching pains</h2> <p>The worst thing about switching, it turns out, is switching.</p> <p>I’m not trying to be tautological. But the bulk of the unpleasantness I’ve experienced actually making this change hasn’t been inherent to Windows, but has either come about because of the differences between the two operating systems, or even just the difficulties in actually getting up and running from day one.</p> <p>Some of the problems are as simple, but nonetheless infuriating, as different keyboard shortcuts. A lifetime of muscle memory has told me that Command-Space brings up Spotlight, which is the main way I opened programmes on my Mac. The same shortcut on Windows 10 is to simply hit the Windows key, which invokes Cortana, Microsoft’s AI assistant, and then typing in the name of the programme you want to open.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e32fbeddf130fdc1d707d3d8c29e8a064ee151c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e32fbeddf130fdc1d707d3d8c29e8a064ee151c/0_0_1970_1182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"windows 10 screen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It’s just all so ... blue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similar mismatches appear in areas like window management, alt-tab behaviour, and programme installation. It’s a push to say which is better (though I maintain that running an installer is less elegant than just dragging an app into the Apps folder), but whichever you’re used to, the other will be worse until you re-educate yourself.</p> <p>That’s not to say I didn’t have plenty to complain about, though.</p> <p>That Spotlight/Cortana mismatch, for instance? It wouldn’t have been so bad, except that Windows maps the alt key to the location of the command key on Macs, and alt-space is the Windows shortcut for switching languages, so every time I failed to invoke Spotlight, I would accidentally switch the language my computer was set up in, resetting my keyboard to a US English layout.</p> <p>That was an annoying problem. Worse was that I didn’t actually have two languages set up on the Surface Book in the first place. And yet, hovering in the bottom right, permanently, was a little box showing whether I was running in UK English or US English, with no option in sight to remove it.</p> <p>In the end, I had to turn to Twitter for troubleshooting advice. We determined that there was no option to remove the US English language because there was no US English language set up. So to remove it, all I had to do was go into a language menu, add English (United States) as an option, and then remove English (United States) as an option. I know. But it worked, so who am I to complain.</p> <p>I’m also firmly aware that a critical eye on Mac OS will reveal many similar bugs. Mac users, particularly long-term, slightly jaundiced, Mac users, have long become familiar with the hollow laugh and invocation of Apple’s erstwhile marketing slogan “It Just Works” as something emphatically continues to not Just Work. In fact, that phrase has been uttered in irony so many times that it’s easy to forget that it really does come from a place of competitive advantage for Apple.</p> <p>That advantage has largely been eroded over the years, as Microsoft has cottoned on to the joys of vertical integration, plug and play accessories, and standards-compliant behaviour.</p> <p>But not entirely. Plugging in an external mouse (an utterly standard Microsoft-made laser mouse), I was annoyed to find that I couldn’t reverse the scrolling behaviour on the scroll wheel to match that of the in-built trackpad. It’s one thing to have to relearn behaviours when you switch machines, it’s another to have to re-learn them every time you plug in a peripheral.<br /></p> <p>About an hour of fruitless Googling later – including several suggestions to install obsolete utilities, hack the registry, or roll back to an earlier version of Windows – and I discovered the way to do what I wanted. I had to download drivers for my mouse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"14f7e41bad69044a07dd442a66555cd783d2eec0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14f7e41bad69044a07dd442a66555cd783d2eec0/0_108_2316_2892/801.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Jobs with the MacBook\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It just works … Steve Jobs with the MacBook Pro in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you’re young, a Mac user, or not particularly technical, that might not mean much. Drivers are the small pieces of software that tell the operating system how to work with hardware, from complex components like graphics cards to simple accessories like this mouse. But the necessity, or not, of drivers for accessories was a big part of that competitive push by Apple, which made a point of ensuring out-of-the-box support for many of the most commonly used peripherals like printers, cameras and mice. When Steve Jobs said “it just works”, this is the sort of thing he was referring to: the ability to plug in a mouse and have it Just Work.</p> <p>Installing drivers for a mouse to enable a niche behaviour is no great hardship, but it still left me moderately concerned. Microsoft made both the mouse and the laptop, yet the two weren’t able to play nicely together without my intervention. This digging in the nuts and bolts of the machine was not something I had missed.</p> <h2>Touching the void</h2> <p>The Microsoft of 2016 has a split personality. In many ways, the split is the same that it’s had for the past 20 years, between its desire for continuity and its desire for reinvention and technological leadership. Where the company is successful today is where that latter desire is ascendant, and the Surface Book is the best example of a forward-looking Microsoft you can find.</p> <p>It’s a fantastic machine. Small and powerful, with a long battery life, it impresses as a laptop, but its real strengths are revealed when you undock the screen from its base. Being able to carry my laptop around the kitchen when doing the weekly shop, before docking it back and typing up some recipes, was genuinely cool.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d66b40531df83586054e33269b4b8bf6d828967\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d66b40531df83586054e33269b4b8bf6d828967/0_0_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not being an illustrator, a graphic designer, or even a graphic thinker, the ability to pop out my laptop and write on it with a (very accurate) stylus was never that useful.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not being an illustrator, a graphic designer, or even a graphic thinker, the ability to pop out my laptop and write on it with a stylus was never that useful.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately, cool is all it was for me. The ability to pop out my laptop and write on it with a (very accurate) stylus was never that useful. If anything, it served to underscore how efficient the keyboard-and-touchpad combo is for a lot of hefty tasks.</p> <p>I had a similar experience with the ability to use the touchscreen while the Surface Book was in laptop mode. I simply didn’t do it much, and most of the time when I did, it was just to see if I could.</p> <p>Occasionally, the touchscreen was actively bad. My first time opening Windows Mail, I was greeted with a helpful popover showing that I could swipe mails to the left to archive them. But I couldn’t work out how: click and drag? Two-fingered swipe on the touchpad? The answer, of course, is to reach up to the screen, and swipe that way. A shortcut it is not, particularly if the screen is up on a dock and you’re already using a keyboard and mouse.</p> <p>Incidentally, unlike many hybrid laptops, the base isn’t just a keyboard: it also contains a second battery, and a number of hardware components including a discrete GPU. (One downside of that setup: if you let the screen run out of battery while undocked, you can’t re-dock it until you’ve charged it separately, even if the base still has some power left).<br /></p> <h2>PCs are from Mars</h2> <p>If this sounds like a long list of nitpicks, it’s because ... well, it is. For all the existential battles that have been fought over Windows versus Mac, there’s little to distinguish the two on any important level. The platforms have converged on everything but aesthetics and personal preferences. Both have a locked-down store which power users ignore; both are fighting for relevance in a world of web apps and mobile-first design; both feel the weight of versions past sitting on their shoulders.</p> <p>If you asked me to explain why, despite it all, I’ve put my money down for a MacBook Pro rather than buying the Surface Book from Microsoft (which loaned the device for this trial), I can give you some reasons that feel solid enough for me. </p> <p>I was shocked by the amount of advertising and cross-promotion riddled throughout the OS, from adverts for apps in the start menu, to a persistent pop-up offering a free trial of Office 365.</p> <p>I was surprised by the paucity of solid third-party apps in general, and particularly by the lack of any good consumer productivity suite. When the most common recommendation, for services from photo storage to calendaring, is “just use Google’s web apps”, there’s a hole waiting to be filled (though maybe that’s just my dislike of web apps in general). It feels like the Mac dev scene is full of teams making fully featured apps that compete with the big companies, while Windows devs are more content to make niche utilities which serve particular needs without needing to start a war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"288f915c5fe4b589b3df4b488b285c80f2f3cff4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/288f915c5fe4b589b3df4b488b285c80f2f3cff4/0_218_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"people using the new MacBook Pro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The MacBook Pro is up to £1,000 more expensive than the Surface Book.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I disliked the lack of a smart sleep mode, meaning my computer would often be flat when I opened it up in the morning because some utility had been running in the background.</p> <p>I hated the difficulty in typing special characters, from foreign accents to ellipses and em-dashes. I hated the lack of a universal paste-as-plain-text shortcut, and I mourned the loss of iMessage access on the desktop for texting my girlfriend.</p> <p>Most of all, though, I couldn’t stand the small irritations, from the failure of Chrome windows to correctly adapt when dragged from a high-res screen to a low-res one, to the trackpad’s inability to accurately click when I used it with my thumb rather than my finger.</p> <p>I don’t pretend that those irritations are unique to Windows, or even that they aren’t things I couldn’t have fixed with time, effort or re-education. But the problem is, fixing them isn’t worth it: the difference just isn’t there.</p> <p>That’s true whichever way you’re thinking of switching. If you’re a Windows user nodding along with my problems, I can guarantee you that within a month of switching to Mac, you’ll have a list just as long. Maybe one day, one or other platform will have a commanding lead. For some use-cases, that’s already happened: gamers have Windows, while iOS developers have Mac, to state two obvious examples. But for now, for the vast majority, it’s hard to say there’s anything in it.</p> <p>Except, of course, for price.</p> <p>Because these problems are minor, and a price difference of up to £1,000 isn’t. The Surface Book is around the same price as the new MacBook Pro, but many other high-quality laptops aren’t: you’ll easily find models like Dell’s XPS range or Lenovo’s Thinkpads for hundreds of pounds less than a comparably-specced MacBook. </p> <p>For me, with four years of saving for a new Mac, good credit, and risk-aversion to digital irritation, it’s worth paying through the nose to stick with what I know. But it might not be the case for you. </p> <p>Switching isn’t a panacea, and there’s no silver bullet out there – no Windows computer that will be anything better than a bit annoying for former Mac users – but before you get too complacent, I have a feeling the same is true the other way round. Ultimately, the question comes down to how much you’re prepared to pay to keep things the same as they have been. For me, it turns out that figure’s quite high. </p>',\n",

However, by reframing the video as an attempt to condemn and raise awareness about violence, the rightwing publication appears to have dodged Facebook’s censors.</p> <p>The case highlights the enormous challenge faced by the social network when it comes to moderating content – particularly when, as in this case, it is uploaded by a media publisher.</p> <p>Facebook has sometimes struggled when deciding how to deal with sensitive journalistic content and was widely criticized for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/09/facebook-deletes-norway-pms-post-napalm-girl-post-row\">removing the iconic Vietnam war photo “napalm girl”</a> for violating its ban on child nudity. In this case, an opinionated and often inflammatory news website has turned the exact same footage into a permissible piece of shareable news content.</p> <p>Sarah Roberts, an information studies professor at UCLA and one of the few academics who study commercial content moderation, said that Facebook has a “huge mess on its hands”.</p> <p>“Material that is barely watchable by most people – whether it’s violent or sexually explicit, but manages not to break the rules – that’s the material that drives the most eyeballs to a site,” she said.</p> <p>The Daily Caller relies heavily on Facebook as a distribution channel, and both are incentivized to get people to click and share content so they can generate advertising revenue. “There’s a symbiosis that would be naive to ignore.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/jan/05/facebook-live-stream-man-attacked-chicago-police-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5jepj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3042082\"            data-video-name=\"Four charged with hate crimes over Facebook Live attack, say police –\\xa0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-586e1871e4b081b2b4eda48b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/01/06/170106chicagoUPD_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/01/06/170106chicagoUPD.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/01/06/170106chicagoUPD_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/jan/05/facebook-live-stream-man-attacked-chicago-police-video\">Four charged with hate crimes over Facebook Live attack, say police – video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Facebook described some of this nuance in a <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/h/community-standards-and-facebook-live/\">blog post last year</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>“One of the most sensitive situations involves people sharing violent or graphic images of events taking place in the real world. In those situations, context and degree are everything. For instance, if a person witnessed a shooting, and used Facebook Live to raise awareness or find the shooter, we would allow it,” the post said. “However, if someone shared the same video to mock the victim or celebrate the shooting, we would remove the video.”</p> <p>Facebook has reporting tools that allow users to flag problematic content. Flagged items get sent to a moderation team, which makes editorial judgements based on the content and context of the item. If an item violates the site’s community standards, it gets removed.</p> <p>The Facebook Live video of the attack on the man in Chicago initially appeared to escape the network’s moderators after the broadcast was allowed to continue for 30 minutes. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/05/facebook-live-video-chicago-attack-explanation\">The company has refused to explain why the live torture video wasn’t removed sooner.</a></p> <p>Facebook and YouTube later deleted the video – and most media outlets have shown only short clips of the footage, blurring out the image of the victim, who has learning difficulties and, police have said, is deeply traumatized. Some news websites that have shown highly edited segments have also run warnings that they contain graphic content.</p> <p>The Daily Caller appears to have resurfaced the video almost in its entirety, without blurring the victim’s face and without including any warnings. The video includes one particularly gruesome scene in which the victim’s scalp is sliced with a knife and has been viewed 7.2m times on Facebook in less than 36 hours.</p> <p>Asked about the apparent inconsistency, Facebook said the statement it released about the original video, which it deleted, also applied to the Daily Caller version of the video, which is currently viewable on the network.</p> <p>“We do not allow people to celebrate or glorify crimes on Facebook and have removed the original video for this reason,” the statement said. “In many instances, though, when people share this type of content, they are doing so to condemn violence or raise awareness about it. In that case, the video would be allowed.”</p> <p>After the Facebook Live broadcast, four suspects were charged with hate crimes, kidnapping and battery. Police identified <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/04/facebook-live-stream-video-man-attacked-chicago-trump\">the suspects</a> as Jordan Hill, Tesfaye Cooper and sisters Brittany Covington and Tanishia Covington. The suspects are all 18 years old except for Tanishia Covington, who is 24.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p></p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, had his annual payout reduced last year after the company failed to reach its 2016 targets.<br /></p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000119312517003753/d257185ddef14a.htm\">Apple’s SEC filings</a>, the company’s annual sales missed its target of $223.6bn (£181.6bn) by 3.7%, reaching only $215.6bn, while operating income came up 0.5% short at $60bn. As a result, Cook received a total payout of $8.75m in 2016, including salary and bonuses, which was down 15% from $10.3m in 2015 and also down on 2014’s $9.2m.</p> <p>Other Apple executives also had their pay decreased, although only by an average of 9.6%. The senior vice president of retail, Angela Ahrendts, was Apple’s top named executive earner, paid $22.9m for 2016.</p> <p>Apple said in its filing: “Our 2016 performance with respect to net sales and operating income was 7.7% and 15.7% below our record-breaking 2015 levels; however, the 2016 payouts to our named executive officers were significantly less than the annual cash incentive payouts for 2015, reflecting strong pay-for-performance alignment.”</p> <p>Cook’s recorded compensation does not account for the 1.26m in Apple shares he was awarded this year, the majority of which were the result of him remaining chief executive for five years, which totalled to a value of $135m in August at the time of disclosure.</p> <p>Apple, like most smartphone retailers, has been faced with increasing competition and slowed growth as many mature markets have reached 80% or higher smartphone penetration. The iPhone made up 63% of the company’s annual revenue, which sold in excess of 45m units in the last quarter of 2016, but was down year on year.</p> <p>As smartphone innovation has appeared to stagnate, and devices have lasted longer, companies including Apple have struggled convince existing smartphone buyers to upgrade. At the same time, the number of buyers seeking their first smartphone has shrunk in Apple’s primary markets of the US and Europe.</p> <p>Launching into markets such as China has helped Apple secure new customer bases, but it, as well as arch rival Samsung, have come under pressure from Chinese rivals. Both were down on market share according to data from Gartner in 2016, with third-quarter market share down 2.5% year on year for Apple and 4.4% for Samsung as China’s Huawei, Oppo and others all rose.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/20/tim-cook-meeting-donald-trump-desktop-macs-apple\"><strong>Tim Cook on why he met Donald Trump and the future of desktop Macs</strong></a><br /></li> </ul>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Over the past few years, wires have been cut for everything from internet connections to earphones – but still, almost every device needs to be plugged in at least once a day to charge. That may be about to change.<br /></p> <p>At CES this year, Dell unveiled the Latitude 7285, a convertible two-in–one Windows 10 computer that gets its power from a desktop wireless charging pad, and Ford announced it would be conducting tests of wireless vehicle charging. But it was Energous that revealed the most interesting development. </p> <p>The four-year-old company, a CES regular, had something to show of its WattUp wireless system, which beams power to devices using radio frequencies, rather than the magnetic induction used in the the contactless charging of certain smartphones of the past few years. Magnetic induction can’t be used over larger distances, radio frequencies potentially can.</p> <p>Energous had six companies showing off devices with WattUp technology powering them. From Bluetooth trackers, hearing aids and styluses, to a small module you can plug into other things, WattUp’s tentative steps into the real world with products you may actually be able to buy are encouraging with one small caveat: it only works over a few centimetres.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6INH8o6GLec\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6INH8o6GLec?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Energous promotional video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Energous claims that these devices will be able to “seamlessly transition from being charged by small, contact-based, portable transmitters, to forthcoming larger transmitters that offer charging at-a-distance of up to 15 feet (4.6m)”.</p> <p>How long before that switch to power at a distance greater than a few centimetres takes is unknown, but one of the WattUp devices is capable of providing 700mAh of power to any microUSB port, a level of power greater than minimum expected of traditional USB supplied power from a computer.</p> <p>While 700mAh is certainly not enough power for something large, yet, it should be easily capable of powering portable devices and the burgeoning Internet of Things ecosystem instead of requiring a USB cable or replaceable battery.</p> <p>Energous also signed a undisclosed deal last year to supply its wireless power system to “one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world” according to the Energous chief executive, Steve Rizzone, <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14124938/energous-truly-wireless-charging-apple-ces-2017\">talking to the Verge</a>. The company <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2016/09/15/proof-that-apple-is-working-with-energous-on-wireless-charging-is-hidden-in-plain-sight/\">also claimed</a> that its technology was going through “Apple compliance testing” suggesting that it might have inked a deal with the Cupertino-based company.</p> <p>Wireless power is still in its infancy, but CES 2017 has marked a significant milestone for the technology. To leap out of the pages of science fiction and into the real world products you might actually buy will need a large electronics firm to put the technology into its products. A company such as Apple or Samsung, which was an early adopter of wireless charging technology, may just be catalyst needed to make it happen.</p>',\n",

The 30-minute assault was watched by 16,000 people, leaving many asking why Facebook didn’t take the content down as it did in the case of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/korryn-gaines-facebook-account-baltimore-police\">police standoff with Korryn Gaines</a>. Facebook did eventually take down the recorded video, but not before it had been copied and widely shared on YouTube.</p> <p>Facebook refused to comment on how many people – if any – reported the content, although there appear to have been many comments under the live stream made by horrified viewers who may have also used the report tool. Nor would Facebook tell the Guardian when it first became aware of the video and how long it took to decide to take the footage down from the site.</p> <p>Instead, a spokeswoman for the company in a statement: “We do not allow people to celebrate or glorify crimes on Facebook and have removed the original video for this reason. In many instances, though, when people share this type of content, they are doing so to condemn violence or raise awareness about it. In that case, the video would be allowed.”</p> <p>Facebook also pointed to a blogpost about <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/h/community-standards-and-facebook-live/\"> community standards for Live Video</a>, where it explains that it has a team on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week “dedicated to responding to reports” from users “immediately”.</p> <p>Reviewers can interrupt a live video stream if it violates the community standards and it only takes one report for an item of content to be reviewed. The company also monitors videos if they reach a certain level of popularity, even if they haven’t been reported.</p> <p>All of which raises difficult questions for Facebook about how the shocking video was broadcast, seemingly uninterrupted, for 30 minutes.</p> <p>“I find it really hard to believe that not enough people reported it,” said Reem Suleiman of SumOfUs, a civil rights group that’s been campaigning for Facebook to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/31/facebook-human-rights-censorship-civil-rights-mark-zuckerberg-aclu\">more transparent about its content takedown process</a>.<br /></p> <p>“I don’t want to speculate here, but we’ve had issues ourselves trying to get certain things taken down in the past,” she added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/17/live-streaming-violent-events-crisis-facebook\">The unpredictable course of live streaming has caught us unprepared</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/17/495827410/from-hate-speech-to-fake-news-the-content-crisis-facing-mark-zuckerberg\">NPR highlighted in November</a>, the role of moderation is carried out by a team of subcontractors operating under pressure, making decisions about pieces of flagged content once every 10 seconds. It’s no surprise that mistakes, such as the inappropriate censorship of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/08/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-napalm-girl-photo-vietnam-war\">celebrated Vietnam War picture</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/20/facebook-bans-swedish-breast-cancer-awareness-video-for-being-offensive\">breast cancer awareness video</a>, are made. Given the complexity and duration of live video streams, it’s difficult to see how they can be effectively assessed under these conditions.</p> <p>Katy Culver, the director of the Center for Journalism Ethics, suggested that perhaps nobody reported the video to Facebook. “Otherwise, I struggle to believe that the platform would not have taken it down,” she said.</p> <p>Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the Guardian on Thursday that police learned of the Facebook video around the same time that the agency encountered the victim and quickly determined that he was the subject of the footage.</p> <p>While patrol officers were assisting the victim, “other units had gotten word of the Facebook video”, he said. “It only took a matter of hours to put this whole case together.”<br />Guglielmi said police had no difficulties acquiring the video and did not make any formal requests to the social media company for help in securing evidence.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/05/facebook-live-beating-anti-donald-trump\">Four suspects have been charged</a> with hate crimes, kidnapping, battery and burglary. Police identified the suspects as Jordan Hill, Tesfaye Cooper, Brittany Covington and Tanishia Covington. The suspects are all 18 years old, except Tanishia Covington, who is 24, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p>The incident once again raises questions about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/12/facebook-2016-problems-fake-news-censorship\">Facebook’s responsibility as a media company</a>. Just as critics are calling for the company to stop the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-fake-news-election-conspiracy-theories\">spread of misinformation on its platform</a>, so too are they demanding Facebook make editorial judgemnts about Live video.</p> <p>“It’s a really good example of why Facebook cannot rely solely on its users to report content. It’s clearly not effective, it’s not good enough,” said Suleiman.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/jan/06/obama-facebook-attack-terrible-but-not-sign-worsening-racial-tensions-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5jjgh\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3045482\"            data-video-name=\"President Obama: Facebook Live attack shows \\'terrible toll\\' racism takes on families – video\"            data-video-provider=\"ABC7 Chicago/AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-586f4ba2e4b0de5081fa2d03\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/01/06/170106chicagoOBAMA_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/01/06/170106chicagoOBAMA.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/01/06/170106chicagoOBAMA_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/jan/06/obama-facebook-attack-terrible-but-not-sign-worsening-racial-tensions-video\">President Obama: Facebook Live attack shows ‘terrible toll’ racism takes on families</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>She acknowledged that the live-streaming tool was valuable for exposing human rights abuses. “But there’s a huge difference between using Facebook to expose violence and corruption and using it to violate, exploit and abuse people,” she said.</p> <p>“If Facebook wants people to use its platform to report news, it needs to be held to the same standard that other news outlets are.”</p> <p>Others believe Facebook should be building better technical solutions for triaging problematic content. </p> <p>“Facebook has to moderate horrifying levels of graphic and upsetting content that emerges around the world every day,” said Claire Wardle of First Draft News. “But this example shows how much further the company has to go in terms of improving their discovery technology to ensure a video like this gets pushed to the top of a moderation queue.”</p> <p>Culver accepts that it is extremely challenging to monitor the volume of content posted to Facebook, but she said the social network appeared to be taking steps in the right direction.</p> <p>“The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/facebook-flag-fake-news-fact-check\">course-correction they did on ‘fake news’</a> indicates they are thinking more about their responsibilities as a platform,” she said.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/05/facebook-live-social-media-live-streaming\"><strong>Facebook Live will change social media – but in what way?</strong></a></li> </ul>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Liviu Babitz opens his collar to reveal a small silicone gadget, the size of a matchbox, attached to his chest with two titanium bars that sit just under the skin. Most resembling a compact bike light, the North Sense that Babitz has attached is an artificial sense organ that delivers a short vibration every time the user faces North. Babitz and Scott Cohen, co-founder at <a href=\"http://www.cyborgnest.net/\">Cyborg Nest</a>, the company that created North Sense, are currently the only two using the product, which will soon be shipped out to clients who have pre-ordered it over the last few months.</p> <p>“Around us is an entire universe we don’t perceive,” Cohen explains. “As we walk down the street there’s radiation, X-rays, infrared and ultraviolet, as well as the electromagnetic field of the planet. So we want to create new senses to become aware of our environment.” Although many people are experimenting with modifying their bodies using technology for medical or experimental purposes, Cyborg Nest are more interested in creating and extending human senses. Two of their other co-founders, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/06/neil-harbisson-worlds-first-cyborg-artist\">Neil Harbisson</a> and Moon Ribas, have both already installed superhuman senses – Harbisson, who is colourblind, has an ‘eyeborg’ that allows him to “hear” the light spectrum (including infrared and ultraviolet), while Ribas has a sensor in her elbow that vibrates when an earthquake occurs anywhere in the world.</p> <p>Northness has always been important to humans as a way to navigate, giving us our most basic system of plotting the world. In fact, speakers of the Australian language <a href=\"http://anthroweb.ucsd.edu/~jhaviland/Publications/ETHOSw.Diags.pdf\">Guugu Yimithirr</a> explain all locations using cardinal points (rather than left and right). Knowing where north is has had great significance for humans across cultures, and yet it’s always been something that we discover, rather than sense directly. </p> <p>Many animals, on the other hand, do have this capacity. Homing pigeons, as well as bats and fruit flies all possess magnetoreception, although what receptor they use to sense the magnetic pole is not clear. There’s even a possibility that humans <a href=\"http://www.sciencealert.com/scientist-claims-he-s-discovered-a-magnetic-sixth-sense-in-humans\">already have this sense</a>, even if we don’t consciously use it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27d9374c3de695c74c3f7b0bbc1a2768ee60da2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27d9374c3de695c74c3f7b0bbc1a2768ee60da2b/0_0_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyborg Nest are less interested in the practical, mundane uses of the North Sense than they are in how it will affect our enjoyment of reality\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyborg Nest are less interested in the practical, mundane uses of the North Sense than they are in how it will affect our enjoyment of reality.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: fabiovh.co.uk/North Sense</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While it’s useful to know whether you’re heading in the right direction, its use as a navigational tool is limited, compared to, say, Google Maps. Cyborg Nest, however, do not intend the North Sense to be used solely as a tool. “It’s about the whole sensory experience that we are having as people,” Babitz explains. They are less interested in the practical, mundane uses of the North Sense than they are in how it will affect our enjoyment of reality, in the same way that now enjoy our other senses. “Biology is cruel in many ways: it gives us exactly what we need to survive and no more,” Cohen says. “The senses that were given to us for survival purposes aren’t used that way any more. I don’t use my eyes to scan the horizon for hordes of marauding invaders, I use my eyes to watch Netflix!” </p> <p>“If we start to focus on building senses for cognitive enhancement, we’re creating tools that change the way we perceive our environment,” says <a href=\"https://www.ravensbourne.ac.uk/staff/carl-smith\">Carl H. Smith</a>, a senior lecturer at Ravensbourne in creative coding. “What’s really interesting about Cyborg Nest is their interest in how they can become technology, how they can adjust their own perception. Like changing the channel on your TV, we should be able to change the way we perceive.”</p> <p>In other words, changing the nature of what we can perceive could change how we experience reality. There’s also the possibility of a domino effect, enhancing the way other senses work. “If, over time, we start using our sight less for orientation because we have another thing helping us, there could be some of the usage of the eye that could develop in another way or start being used for other reasons,” Babitz suggests.</p> <p>Cyborg Nest is now taking <a href=\"http://www.cyborgnest.net/north-sense\">pre-orders</a> for the North Sense, which is charged by a mini USB and entirely waterproof, giving the company a first taste of why its customers are interested in augmenting their senses in this way. “It’s the pioneers who are willing to do it,” Cohen says. “There are people who want the latest gadget before anyone else, who want to be on the bleeding edge of what’s next. We also seem to get into the world of people who do body modification: they want to know what’s next after you’ve been pierced and tattooed.”</p> <p>In a similar way that tattoos were once the preserve of a radical few, Babitz and Cohen expect this form of tinkering with your body to become more widely accepted. Right now, the North Sense is an extreme choice, but will it be seen as such in a few years, as the stigma towards cyborgs (as Babitz and Cohen see themselves as being) wears off? After all, so many of us are already enhanced by technology, whether it’s simply wearing glasses, or implanting pacemakers, cybernetic prosthetics, or electromagnetic identification chips implanted inside the body to control the environment around us. Along this spectrum of modifying our bodies, where should the line between humans and cyborgs be drawn? </p> <p>Cybernetics researcher Professor <a href=\"http://www.kevinwarwick.com/\">Kevin Warwick</a>, deputy vice-chancellor at Coventry University, is avowedly in the latter camp: his work has involved experiments with inserting transmitters beneath his skin, where they interface directly with his nervous system, allowing him to control doors, lights, and later, a robot arm. “I do feel that it is pushing it somewhat to describe North Sense as turning you into a cyborg, but it’s not completely out of bounds, ” he says. “It is well removed from the case of enhancing a human’s brain functioning by directly introducing electronic signals into that person’s brain and enabling their brain signals to directly control technology, with feedback between the two, which I feel is more the expectation of what being a cyborg is about.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cad0b79d1d123e9e2dcc4a77e0f6eaafb018da97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cad0b79d1d123e9e2dcc4a77e0f6eaafb018da97/0_18_1200_1500/800.jpg\" alt=\"Babitz wearing the North Sense\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Babitz (pictured) and Cohen expect this form of tinkering with your body to become more widely accepted.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: North Sense</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To Warwick, it is significant that the sense sits outside the body, rather than being implanted: “Much research has been done to distinguish between the different effects caused if magnets are fitted externally to the person rather than being implanted. So maybe we can regard [the North Sense] as an entry-level cyborg device.”</p> <p>This external placing is important to Cyborg Nest for one major reason: accessibility. It’s much easier for individuals to fit an exosense [a sense that sits outside the body] themselves, than it is to fit a sense under the skin. It’s also the reason for their choice of barbell piercings, widely used in piercing studios, to fit the sense. “In order to develop this as something lots of people around the world could do we didn’t want to say ‘you need to go see a doctor, who may or may not be able to do this’,” Cohen says. By contrast, licensed piercing studios are common around the world, and trained to modify people’s bodies to specification. It’s no coincidence that the four cyborg co-founders chose Steve Haworth, dubbed “The modfather” for his extensive contributions to the body modification community, as their fifth business partner. </p> <p>The North Sense, as it is rolled out, will be experienced by not just one person (as in the case of Harbisson and Ribas) but by a whole community of willing participants, from a 58-year-old woman who rides wild horses in Spain, to an accountant in Chicago. “At the moment, there are no groups of people who have the same artificial senses,” says Babitz. “And you can’t build theories around the experience of just one brain. Now there will be a group of people with the same thing, so we can start understanding what this means in a wider context.” </p> <p>It’s still unclear exactly what the long-term effects of always knowing where north is will be on Cohen, Babitz and the cyborgs-to-be waiting for their tech upgrade in the post. But despite evidence from Harbisson and Ribas that new senses take a long time to perceptually integrate, the pair are already feeling the effects of their new inputs. When I meet them in a London cafe, a week after the launch, both newbie magnetoreceptors turn themselves around before sitting down to figure out how they are positioned. Babitz sits facing south-west, Cohen south-east. </p> <p>Indeed, their new sense has already created a new connection between them: for example, they’ve both been astonished by travelling on the tube: “You have a feeling most of the time that you’re going straight, but you’re sitting there and suddenly ... it buzzes,” Babitz says. “You’re not even going the direction you think you are,” Cohen adds. What the longer term effects on the participants will be isn’t yet clear, but at least they already know which way they’re headed.</p>',\n",

In the suit, Pompliano alleges that Snapchat misrepresented its internal numbers about users and growth, “out of the avarice of the small group of executives” who hope for a huge valuation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/15/snapchat-ipo-video-app-worth\">Snapchat prepares for IPO that could value app at $25bn, reports say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Snapchat will not let anything stand in its way of an IPO, including its obligations to represent material facts accurately,” the suit claims. “Mr Pompliano was terminated because he refused to participate in a scheme to deceive the public and artificially inflate Snapchat’s valuation in anticipation of its IPO.”</p> <p>Seven full pages and several phrases about what Snapchat allegedly misrepresented are redacted in the complaint because of a confidentiality agreement between Pompliano and Snap Inc, the parent company of Snapchat.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Snap, Mary Ritti, said the company had reviewed the complaint. “It has no merit,” she said in a statement. “It is totally made up by a disgruntled former employee.” </p> <p>According to the lawsuit, Snapchat executive Imran Khan and others “repeatedly” made false claims about the company’s numbers to investors, such as the Chinese retailer Alibaba. Pompliano also alleges that Khan and executives misreported at least two statistics to him when they persuaded him to leave Facebook for the burgeoning startup.</p> <p>Snapchat’s CEO, Evan Spiegel, “simply did not care about user engagement metrics”, according to the complaint, until executives realized that such numbers would influence investors in the company’s IPO. </p> <p>Pompliano claims that he raised concerns with three senior executives about misreported numbers, only to be disregarded. The suit alleges that executives, overseeing an “institutional pandemic of misrepresenting” facts, feared Pompliano would alert the press or investors. It also alleges that executives tried to force Pompliano to break agreements he signed with Facebook and reveal proprietary information.</p> <p>Pompliano was fired in September 2015, three weeks after he began work at Snapchat. He claims the company ran a “smear campaign” against him, portraying him as “incompetent”. He is seeking damages and an injunction against the company over this claim, as well as lost wages, “harm to his professional reputation” and punitive damages based on Snapchat’s “misconduct”.</p> <p>Last year, anonymous sources with Snap <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-02/snapchat-passes-twitter-in-daily-usage\">told Bloomberg News</a> that Snapchat had more than 150 million daily users who upload more than 10bn videos a day. In November, Snap filed paperwork for a possible $25bn IPO, according to <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/snap-begins-the-ipo-process-1479244471\">the Wall Street Journal,</a> with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as lead investors. </p> <p>The startup is in a heated competition against Facebook for advertising money, especially in video and messaging. The corporations have waged an arms race of app features since 2013, when Snapchat rejected an acquisitions offer from Facebook. Last September, Facebook was caught having <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/24/business/media/facebook-apologizes-for-overstating-video-metrics.html\">vastly overstated statistics about videos</a>, for more than two years, to advertisers.

We\\xa0will have to ensure that ownership, distribution and use are organised socially rather than by corporate monopolies, which will have no interest in passing on reduced costs; so Wikipedia, not Google. We may also need to take over the manufacturers since they are unlikely to go along with an 80% reduction in production. And we will have to engineer a major shift in social attitudes to ownership if collective benefits are not to be trumped by the premium attached to private convenience and status.<br /><strong>Richard Middleton</strong><br /><em>Castle Douglas, Scotland</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Join the debate – email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>• Read more Guardian letters – </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>click here to visit gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>In August 2015, Facebook rolled out a new feature: the ability to broadcast live video streams from the company’s app for power users, Facebook Mentions. Six months later, the feature, now branded Facebook Live, began a slow rollout for normal users, initially in the United States.</p> <p>In classic Facebook style, the feature was late arriving, slow to roll out, and steadily demolished the competition. Meerkat, the company which ignited the live streaming craze, launched its mobile app in February 2015 and went meteoric at the South by Southwest Festival in March that year. But its time in the sun was limited: shortly after SXSW ended, Twitter subsidiary Periscope launched its own, technically superior, live-streaming service, eclipsing Meerkat almost instantly.</p> <p>For almost a year, Periscope dominated live streaming, peaking, bizarrely, with the phenomenon of 20,000 people watching pedestrians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/06/the-internet-cant-stop-watching-this-livestream-of-people-trying-to-cross-a-puddle\">trying to navigate a large puddle in Newcastle</a>. But Facebook’s sheer scale ensures that when it sets its sights on an area, there’s very little most competitors can do to keep it from rolling over them like a juggernaut.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edd707ffb5eedd33919508d1c934eb4dcd20cd9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edd707ffb5eedd33919508d1c934eb4dcd20cd9a/0_91_917_550/500.png\" alt=\"A snapshot in time of Facebook Live.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A snapshot in time of Facebook Live.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Facebook has thrown resources at its live-streaming product. Extensive developer time, ad budget, and media partnerships are all devoted to ensuring that it’s a success, thanks in part to orders from the very top: its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, is said to personally support the product, which he sees as instrumental to the next stage of Facebook’s growth, and has been one of the most prolific users of the feature, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10103353645165001/\">periodically “going live” on his own Facebook page</a> to answer questions from users.</p> <p>Beyond Zuckerberg himself, Facebook has secured the support of a number of other prominent users – partially by paying for them. Media organisations, including Buzzfeed, the New York Times, and the Guardian, have signed deals with Facebook to produce Live content, in exchange for large payments form the social network.</p> <p>But power users and media firms do little to encourage other Facebook users to go live themselves – a key part of its long-term goal for the feature.</p> <p>To that end, Facebook has also been on an ad blitz, coating key markets such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and London with adverts encouraging users to go live “when you see someone walking an animal that’s not a dog”, “while everyone is waiting for the first suitcase to drop” at an airport, and “when you’re just hanging out with friends or whatever”. The company has also taken a leaf out of archrival Snapchat’s book, offering a plethora of augmented reality “masks” to encourage users to play around with the tech.</p> <p>But none of that had anything to do with the first viral hit to come from Facebook Live. In May 2016, a few months after the feature had launched in the US, 37-year-old Texan Candace Payne <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/candaceSpayne/videos/10209653193067040/\">spent four minutes demonstrating a new gift she had bought for her son</a>: a (real) mask of the Star Wars character Chewbacca, with a pre-recorded roar that plays when the wearer opens their mouth. The short video opens with a charming introduction from Payne, who quickly puts the mask on before collapsing into a fit of giggles which lasts, more or less continuously, for the next three minutes. It currently has 165m views on the social network.</p> <p>In some ways, Payne’s video set the precedent for how Live videos would evolve. For one thing, although the video was broadcast live, the overwhelming majority of its viewers came long after she had put the phone down and stopped broadcasting: the difference from pre-recorded videos was evolutionary, not revolutionary. Payne doesn’t really interact with what audience there was watching her live, either, despite Zuckerberg’s earlier promises that “when you interact live, you feel connected in a more personal way”.</p> <p>But in other ways, the major cultural impact of Facebook Live has little to do with Payne’s joyful short, nor really with the company’s own intentions as communicated through adverts and executive postings.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important choice Facebook made in launching Live was to incorporate it directly into the main Facebook app, unlike Periscope’s initial launch as a standalone product. Facebook is no stranger to spinning popular features off into their own application – most notably with Messenger, in 2014 – but the company’s decision here means that even users who have never felt the need to explore live streaming have the option if they suddenly find themselves in extraordinary circumstances.</p> <p>One such circumstance, which has become almost emblematic of the feature’s social resonance, is that of a confrontation with the state. In July 2016, less than a month after Payne’s video went viral, a very different video was broadcast from Minnesota, where Diamond Reynolds documented the immediate aftermath of a police officer shooting her boyfriend, Philando Castile. The video showed Reynolds calmly telling the officer, and viewers, what had happened: how Castile had been asked for his license and registration, told the officer he was legally carrying a gun, and was shot seven times while subsequently reaching for his license.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b64350726d480863b0afc64bfc7cf7dcbfe2cb1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b64350726d480863b0afc64bfc7cf7dcbfe2cb1c/0_8_615_369/500.jpg\" alt=\"The death of Alfred Olango in a San Diego police shooting was documented on Facebook Live.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The death of Alfred Olango in a San Diego police shooting was documented on Facebook Live.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook Live / Rumbie Mubaiwa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Castile was just the first. Keith Scott Lamont was shot in September in North Carolina, and <a href=\"http://heavy.com/news/2016/09/lyric-youradorable-scott-charlotte-police-shooting-facebook-live-video-streaming-stream-watch-north-carolina-cops-father-killed-daughter/\">his daughter streamed the immediate aftermath</a>. <a href=\"https://fusion.net/story/351914/who-is-alfred-olango/\">The death of Alfred Olango</a>, shot by police in San Diego in September, was streamed by a bystander.</p> <p>The association between Facebook Live and police killings is about more than just being the only camera available. Live streaming has other features that make it appropriate for documenting the tense, dangerous moments in the aftermath of a death.</p> <p>The immediacy of the broadcast can alert loved ones, while acting as a call to arms for the fight for justice. And once the video is uploaded, it’s hard to delete it: important when dealing with an untrusted adversary with the legal power to confiscate devices and suppress footage.</p> <p>Even if police do manage to encourage Facebook to pull the video – <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/349533/twitters-transparency-report-remove-videos-block-police/\">as Baltimore police department did with the account</a> of Korryn Gaines, who live streamed her armed standoff against – by then, copies have likely been made elsewhere.</p> <p>And Facebook’s own systems help. The site aggressively pushes video to the top of newsfeeds while it’s still live, in an effort to encourage the interaction Zuckerberg spoke of, allowing videos to snowball rapidly to large audiences.</p> <p>But those audiences also outpace Facebook’s own ability to moderate content. While videos can be reported, for spam or offensive content, just like other posts, the real-time nature of the events seems to be beyond Facebook’s scope, meaning that videos are often taken down hours after they’ve already ended.</p> <p>That’s useful to activists, who can spread word of a police shooting before the video gets taken down for being “threatening, violent or suicidal”. But it has also led to a second category of videos unique to the service, depicting crimes in process, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/04/facebook-live-stream-video-man-attacked-chicago-trump\">the torture of a disabled man in Chicago</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/14/11930916/france-terrorist-larossi-abballa-facebook-live-video\">a double murder in the name of Isis in France</a>.</p> <p>Facebook could solve that problem, to a certain extent, by throwing money at it: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/10/content-moderation/\">hiring more low-paid contract workers in the anglophone developing world</a> to watch videos of murder and rape so you don’t have to. But that still doesn’t help the company’s larger aim, of making Facebook Live a thing normal people will want to use, not just to watch paid celebrities, but to broadcast their lives to their friends and family. There is a chance that that will never be something that spreads outside of a small niche: but history suggests it’s safer to bet on Mark Zuckerberg than bet against him.</p>',\n",

You give it permission to do this forever – including in forms of media that haven’t been invented yet.</p> <p>In theory, Snapchat is a great choice for sexting because the content is very personal and ephemeral. However, it is worth noting that when you use it, you have given Snapchat the right to “host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish and distribute” your content for the purposes of “operating, developing, providing, promoting and improving” the service. Snapchat also reserves the right to access, review, screen and delete your content at any time. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/15/i-read-all-the-small-print-on-the-internet\">I read all the small print on the internet and it made me want to die</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You are not allowed to create more than one Snapchat account, and if you change your phone number, you have promised to inform Snapchat within 72 hours.</p> <p>Terrorists need not apply, however. You are specifically forbidden from using Snapchat if you appear on the <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx\">US Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals</a> – the 1,000-page US government register of people and businesses facing economic sanctions for terrorism or drugs offences.</p> <p>Have a dispute with Snapchat over something? Then you agreed that it must be resolved by the <a href=\"https://www.adr.org/\">American Arbitration Association</a>, unless you sent Snapchat written notice that you wanted to opt out of this within 30 days of first joining the service.</p> <h2><strong>Instagram: it isn’t responsible if it misplaces your private stuff</strong></h2> <p>As with many other services, <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/478745558852511\">Instagram’s terms of use</a> state that it can use your images for anything, anywhere in the world without paying you, and sell them on to others to do the same.</p> <p>It also explicitly states that you can be suspended from the service or have your username taken from you “for any reason”. </p> <p>Instagram also reserves the right to not always disclose that sponsored content is sponsored.</p> <p>It stipulates that none of your information or messages held on its system are deemed to be confidential, and Instagram is not liable if that information becomes public: “None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Instagram, and Instagram will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.”</p> <h2><strong>WhatsApp: it promises it can’t read your encrypted messages</strong></h2> <p>WhatsApp is much stronger on the privacy of your communications than Instagram. It explicitly states in <a href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#terms-of-service\">its terms</a> that “We’ve built privacy, end-to-end encryption, and other security features into WhatsApp. We don’t store your messages once they’ve been delivered. When they are end-to-end encrypted, we and third parties can’t read them.”</p> <p>However, it also states: “Nothing in our Terms will prevent us from complying with the law.” This gives it an out should legal frameworks about encryption around the world change.</p> <p>The company, owned by Facebook, has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/18/whatsapp-nudge-to-share-data-with-facebook\">caused controversy by sharing data with the social network</a> for use in ad targeting. </p> <h2><strong>Twitter: nasty tweets are not endorsed</strong></h2> <p>Twitter takes the “Retweets are not endorsements” trope of many official bios to the next level, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tos?lang=en\">its terms</a> clarifying that Twitter does not “endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or communications.” Probably just as well, given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/ive-left-twitter-unusable-anyone-but-trolls-robots-dictators-lindy-west\">the level of nastiness that can take place on the platform</a>.<br /></p> <p>As weird legal jargon goes these two sentences from Twitter are probably among the most oddly uninformative ever written into a contract: “Twitter has an evolving set of rules for how ecosystem partners can interact with your Content on the Services. These rules exist to enable an open ecosystem with your rights in mind.”</p> <p>There appears, though, to be no specific clause against heads of state causing diplomatic incidents with their tweets.</p> <h2><strong>YouTube: it suggest you print a copy of its terms and keep it for your records</strong></h2> <p>Clause 2.4 of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/t/terms\">YouTube’s terms of service</a> literally suggests “You should print off or save a local copy of the Terms for your records.”</p> <p>It also states that you should only use the service if you agree to the terms, and you should not use the service if “you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with YouTube” – which has interesting implications for the amount of Minecraft videos on the service aimed at kids.</p> <p>If you want to terminate the legal agreement you have made with YouTube by watching a video, you have to send it in writing. You’ll be able to find the postal address at the top of the terms and conditions that you printed off – assuming you can still remember how to do something as old-fashioned as posting a letter to a company.</p>',\n",

The president elect has publicly derided the agencies on the issue, and this week cited a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/04/republicans-break-donald-trump-tweet-julian-assange-dnc-hacks\">denial</a> by Julian Assange of WikiLeaks that his source for Democratic party emails released during the election was the Russian government or “a state party”. </p> <p>US intelligence agencies have suggested that Russia passed the hacked material to WikiLeaks through intermediaries.</p> <p>Both Clapper and Admiral Michael Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, expressed concerns about intelligence analysts’ morale after Trump’s perceived disparagement of their work, with Rogers suggesting some may quit.</p> <p>Clapper said that Russia “has clearly assumed an even more aggressive cyber posture,” and described the cyber-assault on the 2016 election as “multifaceted”.</p> <p>“Hacking was only one part of it,” he said. “It also entailed classical propaganda, disinformation and fake news.”</p> <p>Yet neither Clapper nor Rogers offered new evidence for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">their October conclusion of Russian interference</a>. Clapper promised to release an unclassified report early next week, prepared by the NSA, CIA and FBI, providing additional information for the intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia deliberately hacked the Democratic National Committee in order to aid Trump in the 2016 presidential election. </p> <p>“We stand more resolutely on that statement than we did on the seventh of October,” Clapper said. Next week’s report will ascribe what Clapper called “more than one motive” to Russian president Vladimir Putin for the assessed electoral interference.</p> <p>Clapper, who has in the past signaled his discomfort with public intelligence testimony – and who has apologized for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/29/james-clapper-condemns-snowden-senate-testimony\">previous false statements</a> to the Senate on the scope of domestic NSA surveillance – said he intends to “push the envelope as much as I can on the unclassified version” of the report “because I think the public should know as much of this as possible”.<br /></p> <p>“They did not change any vote tallies or anything of that sort,” Clapper said of the Russians. He demurred from considering their intrusion an “act of war” while under questioning from committee chairman John McCain, saying that would be a “very heavy policy call” not an intelligence judgment, particularly since the US also penetrates foreign digital networks. </p> <p>“Every American should be alarmed by Russia’s attacks on our nation,” McCain said in his opening remarks. “There is no national security interest more vital to the United States of America than the ability to hold free and fair elections without foreign interference.” </p> <p>Trump’s confidence in WikiLeaks has shocked and angered intelligence analysts, who consider Assange at the least a hostile actor, and at most a tool of Putin. Clapper and Rogers testified they believe Assange has no credibility. “I don’t think those of us in the intelligence community have a whole lot of respect for him,” said Clapper. </p> <p>On Thursday morning, Trump denied he was “in agreement” with Assange, tweeting: “I simply state what he states, it is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth.” </p> <p>He claimed the media “lies to make it look like I am against ‘Intelligence’ when in fact I am a big fan!”</p> <p>Asked about morale within the intelligence agencies in the wake of Trump’s comments, Clapper said: “I haven’t done a climate survey, but I hardly think it helps it.” Rogers said the “confidence of our leaders” helps motivate intelligence officers, “and without that confidence, I just don’t want a situation where our workforce decides to walk, because that’s not a good place for us to be”.</p> <p>The Trump transition team has sought to weaken the impact of the intelligence findings on Russia meddling in the election by highlighting the US intelligence community’s failures over Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion. Clapper claimed that US intelligence collection and analysis had vastly improved since then.</p> <p>“We do make mistakes, but we try to learn from them and makes changes,” he said, insisting that the contrast between US intelligence then and now was “the difference of night and day”.</p> <p>Amid the background of distrust is a plan Trump is reportedly considering to reorganize the US intelligence apparatus. According to the Wall Street Journal, which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-officials-frown-on-donald-trumps-dismissal-of-u-s-intelligence-1483554450\">first reported the proposal</a>, Trump is considering diminishing the director of national intelligence and returning the CIA directorship, under Trump’s pick Mike Pompeo, to its prime role within the intelligence community. Trump’s incoming press secretary Sean Spicer called the report “100% false”.</p> <p>Since Trump’s election, some career US intelligence officials have told the Guardian they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/11/national-security-shift-us-policy-trump-presidency\">fear retaliation</a> for their assessment of Russian electoral interference. A leading figure behind the reported reorganization is said to be Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Flynn, the former Defense Intelligence Agency chief whom Clapper fired in 2014. Clapper said the current intelligence leadership has not been consulted on the plan.</p> <p>While Clapper’s fate is certain, Rogers’ is not. Last month, Barack Obama backed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/12/23/statement-president-signing-national-defense-authorization-act-fiscal\">cleaving the NSA from its military twin</a>, the US Cyber Command, which is responsible for defending military data networks and waging online attack. It is unclear whether Trump will take up this initiative, particularly since it would leave Rogers without a job, as the NSA would be led by a civilian. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/19/nsa-donald-trump-michael-rogers-intelligence-agencies\">congressional outcry</a> followed leaks of the potential change in November.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>McCain, who has a frosty relationship with Trump, denied the purpose of the hearing was to diminish Trump’s electoral victory. </p> <p>McCain notably praised the “dedicated” US intelligence analysts and contextualized Russian interference in the election within what he said was a “provocative” US inability to create a deterrent to digital assault. </p> <p>In a potential preview of partisan responses to the forthcoming report, practically no Republican defended Trump against Clapper’s and Rogers’ assessment.</p> <p>The exception was Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, who suggested that the president-elect’s pledges to expand defense spending and modernize the US nuclear weapons arsenal meant that, contrary to received wisdom, “perhaps Donald Trump is not the best candidate for Russia”. </p> <p>His fellow Republican Thom Tillis did not go as far as Cotton, but sought to minimise the significance of Russia’s actions, referring to a Carnegie Mellon University study that said the US had interfered in 81 foreign elections since the second world war, while the Soviet Union or Russia had interfered in 36. </p> <p>Tim Kaine, the Virginia senator who was former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s running mate during the election, compared Russian interference to the Watergate break-in and implored Congress to “stand in a bipartisan way” against electoral subversion. The GOP congressional leadership is opposing a Democratic push for a special committee to investigate the hack.</p> <p>McCain ally Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, urged Trump to issue a forceful response to Russia and said: “When one political party is compromised, we all are.”</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Even now, well into the second decade of the 21st century, we tend to view video games as a guilty pleasure. For anyone over the age of 25, they’re often something you sneak off to do when no one is at home. They’re a furtive treat, filled with the cultural equivalent of empty calories. </p> <p>Partly this is to do with how video games have been marketed for the last 30 years – predominantly at teenage boys. The games industry has taught us to see games as loud, brash and arcane. On top of this, the most visible titles tend to conform to familiar stereotypes: Call of Duty is about killing enemies; Candy Crush Saga is about killing time. When you’re not entrenched in games, these highly marketed titles become representative – you don’t see the other things going on behind these entertainment monoliths. It’s just like, if you only go to the cinema in the summer, you’re in danger of thinking that all movies involve indestructible people wearing capes. </p> <p>But the last five years has seen a huge renaissance in video game design. The democratisation of the medium (through cheap development tools and the rise of super-fast broadband) has brought in new voices and ideas. Fascinating things are happening.</p> <p>So here are seven reasons why, if you haven’t played many video games in the past, or still feel a little self-conscious about your Xbox or PlayStation, you should try more video games this year – and not feel bad about it.</p> <h2><strong>They’re economical</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02127d45733e85ab39b43a6acfc98ef33414dc61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02127d45733e85ab39b43a6acfc98ef33414dc61/25_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Witcher 3: hundreds of hours of entertainment – and beautiful scenery\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Witcher 3: hundreds of hours of entertainment – and beautiful scenery</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Namco Bandai</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the global economy shows few signs of drastically improving, getting the most out of our entertainment choices is going to be important this year. And video games remain astoundingly good value. A big mainstream release like Witcher 3 or Fifa 2017 will cost around £50 on console and less on PC, but they can provide hundreds of hours of entertainment. Take the online shooting game Destiny. A year after the game’s release, <a href=\"http://www.geek.com/games/how-bungie-devilishly-trapped-its-players-in-destiny-1619668/\">a study of player patterns</a> found that the average session was three hours, and the average player had put 77 hours into fighting alien monsters. That’s an enormous amount of entertainment for that initial £50 outlay. </p> <p>Most titles have replayability features built in. Big adventure games like Dishonored, Assassin’s Creed and Tomb Raider are filled with sub-quests, hidden areas and collectible items that encourage and reward replay and exploration. Competitive multiplayer titles such as Overwatch, Fifa and Rocket League effectively function like sports – you play and improve over many months, discovering new skillsets and features. And of course, waiting a few weeks before buying a game, or looking out for sales on download sites like Steam, Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, will get you those experiences for even less money.<br /></p> <h2><strong>They’re culturally prescient</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a444d82385dadbd4bcc9f281c72bc414a9bfc16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a444d82385dadbd4bcc9f281c72bc414a9bfc16/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Westworld: it’s basically about video games\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Westworld: it’s basically about video games</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A lot of the people now making, producing and funding television and movies grew up playing video games – and that influence is becoming ever more obvious and important. Two of the most interesting television programmes of 2016, Mr Robot and Westworld, were inspired by game design and conventions – the latter has been <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/10/the-gamers-of-westworld/505970/\">widely read</a> as a comment on the sorts of interactive immersive worlds we find in games. We’re now seeing the very structure, culture and design principles of games being expressed and explored in traditional narrative media. </p> <p>From the deeply interconnected Marvel movies, filled with easter eggs, clues and puzzles, to the rise of immersive theatre productions, we’re being asked to take more of an active role in the entertainment we consume. So playing video games is effectively preparing you for the future of broadcast media, and ensuring you understand what’s going on in, say, the next Ready Player One, or Stranger Things or the films of Alex Garland, JJ Abrams or Duncan Jones. </p> <h2><strong>They’re social</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"230d1512ab32e6320b1232dea7a5894515eda2eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/230d1512ab32e6320b1232dea7a5894515eda2eb/0_717_8984_5391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Music titles like Singstar show that games can be social and inclusive\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Music titles like Singstar show that games can be social and inclusive</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sony</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The popular stereotype of the lone gamer sat in a bedroom staring at a screen was never particularly accurate, but now its laughably out of date. Most titles have multiplayer components that let you easily play against other people online – but if that’s too intimidating, there are also a lot of “local” or “couch” multiplayer games that you can share with friends in the same room. Recent examples include the hilarious cooperative kitchen game Overcooked, the crazed VR experience Keep Talking and No One Explodes, and the beautiful puzzler Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime. But you can also pick up a cheap old Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, grab a copy of Rock Band or Guitar Hero and enjoy many nights of terrifyingly incompetent karaoke fun.</p> <p>But in a lot of important ways, almost all games can be shared. I know a lot of couples who sit down and play adventure games like Life is Strange or Walking Dead together, taking turns with the controls, helping each other, discussing tactics and options. We learn a lot about our friends through play, and how you cooperate on video game tasks is a pretty good indicator on how you will cope with real-life challenges. In short, video games will save your relationship. I’m only half joking.</p> <h2><strong>They’re the future of self-expression</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcb39157817d9def51ca93ec76b19905f948cbbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcb39157817d9def51ca93ec76b19905f948cbbe/90_0_2690_1615/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Designer Nina Freeman starring in her own video game, Cybele\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Designer Nina Freeman starring in her own video game, Cybele</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thirty years ago, when young angry people wanted to express something about their lives, they would pick up a guitar and write a song; if they wanted to tell a story, they might have written that as poetry or bought a camcorder and made a film. Now they’re just as likely to make a game. Cheap tools like Unity, free creation packages like Twine and Scratch, all put development into the hands of anyone with a basic laptop. Creators like Anna Anthropy, Nina Freeman, Robert Yang and Jason Rohrer make idiosyncratic, personal, troubling, unusual and political games, exploring new avenues for self-expression, pushing at the boundaries of what games are and what they can say. Games have become the permissive creative space that punk rock once was.</p> <p>On a more mainstream level, we’re gradually seeing the barriers between interactive and linear media being broken down. Over the last decade, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/sep/26/media.broadcasting\">Dubplate Drama</a> to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-16/defiance-syfys-ultimate-transmedia-adventure\">Defiance</a>, there have been halting experiments in transmedia – the combination of game, web and television elements to create new story forms – but these will inevitably become more common as generation swipe matures. Games will break out of two-dimensional screens and into rooms, either through VR or AR, or through new combinations of TV and tablets. It’s possible that in twenty years, the idea of sitting down and just <em>watching</em> a narrative drama will seem outdated and anachronistic. So you may as well start practising now.</p> <h2><strong>They tell us where technology is going</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4a82071601f2e57eba4c938ec6d7de0fa22a294\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4a82071601f2e57eba4c938ec6d7de0fa22a294/0_224_3362_2018/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People test virtual reality Samsung Gear VR glasses at the Grand Palais exhibition hall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People test virtual reality Samsung Gear VR glasses at the Grand Palais exhibition hall</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Video game players are hugely demanding when it comes to interface design – both in terms of input devices (ie controllers) and in-game information displays. Video games are also pushing the envelope when it comes to artificial intelligence, procedural content generation and physics modelling. This means a lot of the technologies that are going to affect our lives in the next decade are being tested and developed in the video game sphere.</p> <p>Sometimes this is obvious. Currently, most virtual and augmented reality development is in video games: the PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets are mostly being used to make games, but that won’t always be the case – when headsets become less unwieldy and when more movie and television companies start to explore the possibilities of 360-degree video, VR and AR experiences are going to become a lot more common. We’ll be shopping in VR, attending sports events in VR, using AR to redesign our living rooms. Learning about these technologies now is a good idea.</p> <p>But there are less obvious ways that games are taking a role in shaping our futures. Video games have become important testbeds for artificial intelligence research. The Google-owned AI company DeepMind tests its intelligent programs by pitting them against video games – the latest example is StarCraft. In the US, Dr Mark Riedl and his colleagues at Georgia Tech university have developed a game-like narrative platform called Quixote, where AI agents are able to learn moral lessons from player-created stories; this approach could well be used in the coming years to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/18/robots-could-learn-human-values-by-reading-stories-research-suggests\">teach robots how to make moral decisions</a>. Microsoft’s research department in Cambridge is using Minecraft <a href=\"http://blogs.microsoft.com/next/2016/07/07/project-malmo-lets-researchers-use-minecraft-ai-research-makes-public-debut/#sm.00000e4ybdwo39f6ezmft8j1qpvd6\">to test and teach AI bots</a>. </p> <p>The future of communication with our major service providers – from banks to retailers – is with intelligent chatbots. Games offer practice in talking to machines.</p> <h2><strong>They tell us about our kids</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b1e6e2c8eaf0753e19c958f2d753c75cc5fbe88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b1e6e2c8eaf0753e19c958f2d753c75cc5fbe88/0_187_5126_3076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A growing number of children now expect all screens to be interactive\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A growing number of children now expect all screens to be interactive</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the arrival of smart phones and tablets, games are more pervasive than ever. Children are now growing up expecting all screens to be interactive – a phenomenon that’s being referred to as <a href=\"http://digitaluncovered.com/generation-swipe-what-toddlers-know/\">generation swipe</a>. They are using tablets in school, they’re being taught to code, and they’re creating apps. They are digital natives. Alongside this, the mass adoption of social media platforms like Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube has given rise to a new relationship between teens, technology and entertainment. Kids expect to be able to interact. They watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/stampylonghead/videos\">Stampy</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/PewDiePie/videos\">PewDiePie</a> on YouTube and interact with pro gamers and vloggers on Twitch streams – they communicate with each other through memes and photos. A lot of the interfaces they use are game-like. So understanding video games is important.</p> <p>But more than this, playing video games with your kids is joyous. Whether that means building a castle together in Minecraft, or a functioning rocket in Kerbal Space Program, or just solving puzzles and breaking things in Lego Dimensions, it’s a way of meeting with your children in a domain they enjoy and feel comfortable. It lets them take the lead; it lets them show you stuff. The skills are also transferable and can expand into the real world. The obvious example is Pokémon Go, the AR game which turns local landmarks into playable spaces – my sons have learned more about their hometown through playing this game than through years of just walking around. But games can also stimulate an interest in architecture, ecology, physics, logic, philosophy ... I’m an optimist in this area; some argue that video games provide only insular lessons applicable solely within their own worlds. But having a child on the autism spectrum, I have seen first-hand how games can inspire an interest in the world and its mysteries.</p> <h2><strong>They’re fun</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"720ba5673f136c023c7ef06dfe5893a08fc62fac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/720ba5673f136c023c7ef06dfe5893a08fc62fac/60_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grand Theft Auto V – because you will probably never crash land a helicopter on an LA freeway in real-life\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grand Theft Auto V – because you will probably never crash land a helicopter on an LA freeway in real-life</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rockstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did I mention this? Games are fun. They provide fascinating worlds to explore and take part in, they let us do incredible, sometimes terrible things without recourse. They test out intelligence and reaction; they posit weird futures and possibilities; they let us take control of lives and bodies that we could never own or experience. They are made by artists and visionaries, they provide moments of utter transfixing beauty and resonance. The glowing sunset over the city of Los Santos in GTA V, the swoop of a dragon over the plains of Skyrim; the desperate struggle to survive in the snowy wastelands of The Long Dark; the heart-wrenching power of friendship in Life is Strange – these are valid forms of escape and experience; they tell us things. </p> <p>In 2017, a year of uncertainty and vast technological change, it is time to see video games alongside – and equal to – books, television and cinema as a popular imaginative medium. It is OK to play. </p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>“It’s like owning your own newspaper – without the losses.” That’s how Donald Trump described the San Francisco-headquartered social media tool in November 2012.</p> <p>In a little over four years, the celebrity businessman turned president-elect has grown his Twitter audience from about 2 million followers to almost 19 million, using it as his personal Pravda to post propaganda and stream-of-consciousness musings .</p> <p>His prolific and opinionated 140-character outpourings (“tremendous!”, “very unfair!”, “crooked”, “nice”) are amplified by traditional media, reporting on his  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/458763139866435584\">ad hominem attacks</a> and  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/12/donald-trump-questions-us-commitment-to-one-china-policy\">diplomatic gaffes</a>.</p> <p>For Twitter, it’s been a marketer’s dream: barely a day goes by without TV channels, newspapers and websites name-checking the social media platform in stories about what @real Donald Trump is posting.</p> <p> President-elect Trump promises to Make America Great Again, but could he also Make Twitter Great Again?</p> <p>Twitter had a troubled 2016, with a series of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/technology/twitters-chief-technology-officer-to-leave-company.html\">high-profile executives leaving</a> the company a s it struggled to attract more users (it s user base has plateaued at around 300 million) and suffered from slowing revenue growth.</p> <p>There were rumours the company might <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/26/twitter-sale-benefit-buyers-google-disney-salesforce\"> be sold to Salesforce or Disney</a>, but discussions were not fruitful. Since then the company has been in cost-cutting mode, shedding staff and paring back some of its business operations, including video-sharing platform Vine.</p> <p>Now the company could benefit from its most talked-about user’s ascent to the White House.</p> <p> “Trump is the best thing that ever happened to Twitter,” said analyst Michael Pachter, from Wedbush Securities. “It’s like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfAzUAxWELU\">E.T. eating Reese’s Pieces!</a>” he said, referring to one of the earliest examples of product placement.</p> <p>So keen on the platform is Trump that he’s even using it to announce potential policy changes, bypassing the conventions of White House press team filters. Despite promising in November to <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/13/trump-tells-60-minutes-he-will-be-restrained-on-twitter-as-president.html\">be “very restrained, if I use it at all” in his social media use once</a> he’s president, Trump has already hinted he’d like to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/811977223326625792\">change decades of policy on nuclear weapons</a> and praised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/30/russia-plans-immediate-counter-measures-us-diplomats\">Vladimir Putin as “very smart”</a>, even after intelligence agencies said Russia tried to influence the US election .</p> <p></p> <p>Trump hasn’t held a <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/12/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-press-conferences\">traditional press conference</a> since July 2016, opting instead for combining controlled settings of interviews with Twitter, which he views as a way of <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-60-minutes-interview-weighs-twitter-use-as-president/\">“fighting back” against stories he considers to be inaccurate or bad</a>.</p> <p>“This is his way of controlling the news cycle. He’s brilliant at that,” said analyst Leigh Drogen, founder and CEO of Estimize.</p> <p>Trump’s use of the microblogging platform is raw and, for a person of his stature, unprecedented – or, to use the term he erroneously tweeted, ‘<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/17/trump-faces-unpresidented-moment-on-twitter.html\">unpresidented</a>’ .</p> <p>But it is a huge marketing asset for the tech firm, which is being portrayed by Trump and his associates as an influential tool. “You know what? The fact of the matter is that when he tweets, he gets results,” Trump’s incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, recently remarked.</p> <p>The question is, can Twitter convert such a priceless endorsement into business success?</p> <p>“I’ve not yet seen Twitter do anything to market the site to non-users. They are failing to exploit an opportunity,” said Pachter. Drogen agrees, citing <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2013/11/07/zuckerberg-called-twitter-clown-car-fell-gold-mine/\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> in describing the company as “a clown car that fell into a goldmine”.</p> <p>“They have never actually grown out of that. They just fell into where they are. Trump will keep them relevant but it’s up to Twitter to figure out how to appeal to a larger set of people,” Droge said.</p> <p>He pointed out that because of the lack of effective marketing, most non-users of Twitter joke that its purpose is to tell people what you had for breakfast. Twitter’s real value, he said, is as a breaking news source and that not all users need to post content. “99% of people should just be following news sources and celebrities, but Twitter has never really made that connection for people.”</p> <p>Pachter is more hopeful, arguing that having shed most of the company’s management team CEO Jack Dorsey now has a “blank slate”.</p> <p> “Every person who voted for Trump should be following him on Twitter. Why aren’t they marketing it to the RNC?”</p> <p>The flipside of Trump’s presence on Twitter, however, is the swell of harassment on the platform, much of which is fuelled by the pro-Trump alt-right. This has led to a number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/ive-left-twitter-unusable-anyone-but-trolls-robots-dictators-lindy-west\">high-profile departures from the platform</a>.</p> <p>“I think harassment is a problem. There are no consequences for being an asshole on Twitter and there should be,” said Pachter, who suggests an Uber-style rating system for users, where people would get suspended for the site for a short period if they continually got bad scores.</p> <p>Both Pachter and Drogen are intrigued to see what will happen with the @realDonaldTrump account once the president-elect is inaugurated. By that point he may be using the official White House <a href=\"https://twitter.com/POTUS\">@POTUS</a> Twitter account.</p> <p>“Normally the president takes a very nuanced view of what he wants to say and goes through several levels of filter before it gets out to people,” said Drogen.</p> <p>Trump’s recent tweets do not suggest he is about to adopt a more presidential approach to his account.</p> <p>Drogen believes that once in power, however, the gap between what Trump says on Twitter and what he does will become more obvious, particularly when it comes to business , where he’s been able to shift financial markets with single tweets<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/12/13/donald-trump-twitter-lockheed-martin-stock-dump/\"> </a>.</p> <p></p> <p>“He’s going to keep saying crazy stuff because his brain is connected to fingers and fingers are connected to the phone, but I think the market is going to discount those things.” He added: “It’s not real policy, it’s literally just a dude saying things.”</p> <p>Perhaps that could be Twitter’s new strapline?</p>',\n",

Maintaining it will cost about 15m yen (£100k) a year.</p> <p>The move is unlikely to be welcomed, however, by 34 employees who will be made redundant by the end of March.</p> <p>The system is based on IBM’s Watson Explorer, which, according to the tech firm, possesses “cognitive technology that can think like a human”, enabling it to “analyse and interpret all of your data, including unstructured text, images, audio and video”.</p> <p>The technology will be able to read tens of thousands of medical certificates and factor in the length of hospital stays, medical histories and any surgical procedures before calculating payouts, according to the Mainichi Shimbun.</p> <p>While the use of AI will drastically reduce the time needed to calculate Fukoku Mutual’s payouts – which reportedly totalled 132,000 during the current financial year – the sums will not be paid until they have been approved by a member of staff, the newspaper said.</p> <p>Japan’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/07/japanese-village-dolls-ageing-population-nagoro\">shrinking, ageing population</a>, coupled with its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/31/erica-the-most-beautiful-and-intelligent-android-ever-leads-japans-robot-revolution\">prowess in robot technology</a>, makes it a prime testing ground for AI.</p> <p>According to a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/04/robots-expected-to-run-half-of-japan-by-2035\">report</a> by the Nomura Research Institute, nearly half of all jobs in Japan could be performed by robots by 2035.</p> <p>Dai-Ichi Life Insurance has already introduced a Watson-based system to assess payments - although it has not cut staff numbers - and Japan Post Insurance is interested in introducing a similar setup, the Mainichi said.</p> <p>AI could soon be playing a role in the country’s politics. Next month, the economy, trade and industry ministry will introduce AI on a trial basis to help civil servants draft answers for ministers during cabinet meetings and parliamentary sessions.</p> <p>The ministry hopes AI will help reduce the punishingly long hours bureaucrats spend preparing written answers for ministers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/20/automated-city-robots-run-public-services-councils\">The automated city: do we still need humans to run public services?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the experiment is a success, it could be adopted by other government agencies, according the Jiji news agency. </p> <p>If, for example a question is asked about energy-saving policies, the AI system will provide civil servants with the relevant data and a list of pertinent debating points based on past answers to similar questions.</p> <p>The march of Japan’s AI robots hasn’t been entirely glitch-free, however. At the end of last year a team of researchers abandoned an attempt to develop a robot intelligent enough to pass the entrance exam for the prestigious Tokyo University.</p> <p>“AI is not good at answering the type of questions that require an ability to grasp meanings across a broad spectrum,” Noriko Arai, a professor at the National Institute of Informatics, told Kyodo news agency.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<blockquote> <p>I bought a budget Acer netbook knowing I’d be forced to keep an eye on the applications I installed, and be more organised with external storage. I’m holding up my end of the bargain, but Windows 10 most certainly isn’t. Despite a relatively hassle-free installation, there has been an endless stream of prompts to free up space so it can update.</p> <p>I have next to nothing installed except absolute essentials such as Chrome, OpenOffice and iTunes. My iTunes library is on an external USB, and isn’t to blame. Despite this, I have less than 3GB left.</p> <p>There seems to be the option of using external drive space to complete the Windows 10 upgrade, but what about updates once you’re saddled with it? <strong>Stuart</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>I don’t know if this is a response to my little rant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2016/dec/29/which-is-the-best-cheap-windows-laptop-for-my-mum\">last week</a>, but either way, it’s a good question. For those who missed it, I said: “I think 32GB Flash memory drives are too small for traditional laptop uses. Microsoft has reduced the size of Windows 10 ... but it’s going to get bigger with use. There will be numerous upgrades, growing log files, swap files, and large caches of temporary internet files. Looking three years or six upgrades ahead, I can’t see a 32GB drive coping without some massive clean-ups.”</p> <p>PC manufacturers are fitting 32GB eMMC Flash storage chips to cut costs. High quality 64GB chips are around twice the price, and the extra, say, $12 to $15 is significant if you’re selling a system for £149.99 or $199.99. In the long term, users would be better off paying a higher price for 64GB of storage, but this is not widely understood.</p> <p>Either way, you probably need a couple of accessories: an SD card, and an external USB hard drive (EHD).</p> <p>Windows 10 can use extra space on the EHD to install updates even when your C: drive has run out of space. If so, this will be mentioned on the pop-up that says “Windows needs more space”. You can also use the EHD to back up your PC. I strongly recommend doing that before you try any of the tips below.</p> <h2><strong>Using an SD card</strong></h2> <p>Most netbooks and Windows tablets have a slot for an SD or microSD card. This is a quick way to add 32GB or 64GB or sometimes even more storage. You can create an icon for the card and keep it on the desktop for quick access.</p> <p>If you have large collections of photos, music, movies etc then you can store them on SD cards. Further, you can now install programs on SD cards, too. To do this, run the Settings app (the cogwheel), select System, then Storage, and look for “Save locations”. Whenever it says “This PC (C:)”, you can change it to save to your SD card.</p> <p>You can also move existing programs to your SD card. To do this, go to “Apps &amp; features” in the Settings app, and sort them by size. Click on a large program, and Windows 10 will give you two options: Move and Uninstall. Click Move. The pop-up will say: “This app is currently installed on: This PC (C:) Select a drive to move this app to”. Again, use the drop-down menu to select your SD card.</p> <p>Note: don’t move frequently used essentials such as drivers and anti-virus programs. It’s probably not worth moving anything smaller than 50MB.</p> <h2><strong>Removing apps</strong></h2> <p>Go back to “Apps &amp; features” in the System section of the Settings app, and sort programs by size. There may be some that you want to uninstall, such as Candy Crush Soda Saga, and any trial version of Microsoft Office. You can also uninstall some parts of Windows 10, but most apps are not actually installed until you use them. You only have placeholders.</p> <p>On my system, Windows 10’s Get Started app took up 44K. After I used it to watch several help videos, its size swelled to 42.5MB. Many Windows 10 apps only take up a couple of megabytes, and I have 15 apps that only take up 16K each (Maps, Sport, Voice Recorder, Weather etc). It’s not worth uninstalling these placeholders. The space saving is trivial and the next major Windows 10 update will just put them back. Life’s too short.</p> <p>Note that Windows 10 will not uninstall some core apps – such as Mail, Photos, and Groove Music – but <a href=\"https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download\">CCleaner Free</a> will. Just select Tools, then Uninstall. However, as mentioned above, you won’t save much space, and at some point, Windows 10 will put them back. Just don’t uninstall the Windows Store app.</p> <h2><strong>Saving storage space</strong></h2> <p>The quickest way to clear space in Windows is to run Microsoft’s built-in Disk Clean-up utility, or an alternative such as CCleaner Free, as explained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2016/dec/22/which-programs-should-i-install-when-setting-up-windows-10\">two weeks ago</a>. Only do this after you have made sure you know all your log-on IDs and passwords, and you have saved your browser session, so that you don’t lose all your open tabs. By default, CCleaner will remove the history files and cookies used to store this information.</p> <p>Microsoft’s Disk Clean-up utility can safely delete hidden system files. Click the button that says “Clean up system files” for the option to delete various files including “Previous Windows Installation(s)”.</p> <p>Next, go back to the Storage page and click on your C: drive. Windows 10 will scan your 32GB and tell you how much space you have free. After a while, it will also tell you what’s taking up space. The entries will include System &amp; reserved, Apps &amp; games, Documents, Pictures, Music etc. There will also be entries for Mail, OneDrive, Temporary files and Other.</p> <p>Click each entry for more information and the chance to manage it. Click “System &amp; reserved” to see how much space Windows 10 is using for system files, virtual memory (ie the <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5426041/understanding-the-windows-pagefile-and-why-you-shouldnt-disable-it\">pagefile.sys file</a> used as a scratchpad), hibernation (the hiberfil.sys file stores your PC’s state while it’s asleep, and is used by <a href=\"http://www.howtogeek.com/243901/the-pros-and-cons-of-windows-10s-fast-startup-mode/\">Fast Startup</a>) and system restore (system files you would need to restore your PC to an earlier state).</p> <p>These work files may well take up more space than Windows 10. There’s not much you can do about them without some expertise, the old Control Panel and a few DOS-type commands. However, you can limit how much virtual memory Windows can use – though it will work badly if it doesn’t have enough – and the space available for system restore files. You can also move the hibernation file to your SD card.</p> <h2><strong>Hard drive management</strong></h2> <p>Finally, and most dangerously, you can check your hard drive partitions. Windows 10 creates its own small recovery partition, WinRE, which doesn’t have a drive letter. It’s what lets you re-set your PC. I would never delete it. However, if you upgraded to Windows 10, your PC may still have an OEM recovery partition for an earlier version of Windows. You can delete this and – most importantly – reclaim the space by using a free program such as <a href=\"http://www.partition-tool.com/\">EaseUS Partition Master</a> or <a href=\"http://www.disk-partition.com/free-partition-manager.html\">AOMEI Partition Assistant</a>.</p> <p>You can also, of course, accidentally brick your PC. It’s important to create “recovery media” and a back-up before messing with this stuff.</p> <h2><strong>Install Windows from USB</strong></h2> <p>Microsoft is releasing two major versions of Windows 10 each year. The next one, the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/upcoming-features\">Creators Update</a>, is being tested now. These updates are installed as new operating systems, in just the same way as the upgrade from Windows 7 or 8.1 to 10. This means you need space for the large download, the working operating system, and a back-up copy of the old version. This is stored in a hidden folder called “Windows.old” in case you need to roll back to it.</p> <p>However, you can also download the latest version on a different PC and use Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10\">Media Creation Tool</a> to create installation media on a 4GB or larger USB thumb drive or DVD. You must select the option to “Create installation media for another PC” and choose the correct version for your laptop (64-bit Windows 10 Home, or whatever). You may also need to set your laptop to boot from USB. You don’t need a product key as your Windows 10 activation is stored online against the Microsoft Account you use to log on.</p> <p>You can use this approach to “<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10startfresh\">Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10</a>” as per Microsoft’s instructions. However, it removes all the programs that are not part of Windows 10, including your manufacturer’s apps, support apps, drivers, customised power and sleep settings, and so on. While you can opt to keep personal files, you may lose digital licenses and related content you have paid for. You must back them up.</p> <p>It’s not as simple as letting Windows 10 auto-update, but at least you’ll end up with the latest version of Windows 10 and the maximum amount of free storage space.</p> <p><strong>Have you got another question for Jack?

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Chaos Communications Congress is the world’s oldest hacker conference, and Europe’s largest. Every year, thousands of hackers gather in Hamburg to share stories, trade tips and discuss the political, social and cultural ramifications of technology.</p> <p>As computer security is a big part of the hacker world, they also like to break things. Here are five of the most important, interesting, and impressive things broken this time.</p> <h2><strong>Intercoms</strong></h2> <p>The internet of things has been a security disaster since the days it was no more than a glint in a marketing manager’s eye. It turns out cheap hardware that can’t be easily updated but is permanently connected to the internet is a nightmare for users and a goldmine for hackers.</p> <p>So if your house is accessed through an internet-of-things intercom, you might want to ensure you have an old fashioned back-up lock to keep things shut while you’re away.</p> <p>Sebastien Dudek, a researcher at French firm Synacktiv, revealed his research on hacking smart intercoms, which replace the conventional built-in phone with a connection to the phone network. When a visitor arrives, the intercom makes a call, either to a landline or a mobile, and the resident can simply hit a key on their phonepad to let their visitor in.</p> <p>Of course, that only works if the intercom actually calls your phone. If it can be intercepted to call another random phone, then the door’s open to allcomers.</p> <p>For the simplest type of intercom, which uses a mobile phone SIM card to simply dial the target phone number directly, Dudek was able to use a piece of commodity hardware to spoof the mobile base tower and intercept the call directly.</p> <p>Some more complicated intercoms instead call a preset command station, which then routes the call through to the final number. That could be more secure, but in practice, Dudek says it just introduces new avenues of attack.</p> <p>For one thing, the central server allowed Dudek to compromise multiple intercoms at once. From there, he proposed a number of potential exploits: an attacker could change all the intercoms to premium rate numbers, for instance, raking in the cash whenever anyone has a visitor; or they could use a reverse look-up service to track down where each intercom is connected and organise a mass break-in.</p> <h2><strong>Boarding Cards</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1fd8e6915f32efdfa1451a3ee0f1d8951a69745e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fd8e6915f32efdfa1451a3ee0f1d8951a69745e/0_67_347_208/347.jpg\" alt=\"Dating back to 1960, the international travel booking network was one of the first global networks to ever be created.\" width=\"347\" height=\"208\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dating back to 1960, the international travel booking network was one of the first global networks to ever be created.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The international travel booking network is one of the wonders of the world. Dating back to 1960, it was one of the first truly global networks to ever be created, and it is still responsible today for letting you book a flight from anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world, no matter where in the world you happen to be at the time.</p> <p>Unfortunately, computer security has come on a bit since 1960, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/28/airline-passenger-details-online-bookings-easy-prey-hackers-say-researchers\">the security on the Global Distribution Systems … hasn’t</a>.</p> <p>Researchers Karsten Nohl and Nemanja Nikodijevic, of <a href=\"https://srlabs.de/bites/travel-hacking/\">German research firm SRLabs</a> demonstrated the resulting weaknesses in front of a live audience, brute-forcing booking records, showing how easy it would be to steal airline miles or even whole tickets, and revealing how personal data stored in the booking system is barely protected at all.</p> <p>The heart of the insecurities lies in the six-character booking code, printed on everything from baggage tags to boarding cards and confirmation emails. Six characters is few enough that a valid code can easily be guessed, even if it can’t be simply found by rummaging through bins in an airport, and most vendors only use another public fact – your surname – to secure it beyond that.</p> <p>“Global booking systems have pioneered many technologies including Cloud computing,” the researchers said. “Now is the time to add security best practices that other Cloud users have long taken for granted.”</p> <h2><strong>Smart Meters</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0757ab55701b88b9275fc32f74043dd64715bc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0757ab55701b88b9275fc32f74043dd64715bc1/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a smart meter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At its worst, argued Nethanel Ruben, a hacked smart meter could cause explosions or house fires.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NONE/None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What’s even more concerning than an insecure smart home? An insecure smart city. Netanel Rubin, co-founder of the security firm Vaultra, presented his research on smart meters, electricity meters that co-ordinate with the utility company and other meters on the same network to ensure that the power grid of a city is fit for the 21st century.</p> <p>When used well, smart meters offer a host of advantages: individuals can keep better track of their usage, utilities can offer flexible tariffs to encourage use when the grid is underloaded, and microgeneration can be rewarded, letting utilities pay people for fitting solar or wind generation to their properties.</p> <p>Unfortunately, some smart meters are anything but secure. Using a similar technique to Dudek, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/29/smart-electricity-meters-dangerously-insecure-hackers\">Rubin managed to intercept the communications between the smart meter and the utilities company itself</a>. That would enable billing fraud (either stealing free electricity, or maliciously increasing the bills of victims), as well as privacy invasions.</p> <p>Things get worse if a user has other smart devices in their house, such as a smart door lock. “Imagine you woke up to find you’d been robbed by a burglar who didn’t have to break in,” Rubin said.</p> <p>At its worst, he argued, a hacked smart meter could cause explosions or house fires. The devices are designed with the goal of rendering that an impossibility, but then, they are also designed with the goal of rendering hacking them impossible. Not every design goal is achieved.</p> <p>The UK department charged with implementing smart meters, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/15/energy-storage-vital-to-keep-uk-lights-on-say-mps\">Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS)</a>, says that “robust security controls are in place across the end-to-end smart metering system and all devices must be independently assessed by an expert security organisation, irrespective of their country of origin”.</p> <h2><strong>Elections</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9573cfe6428bdb7c569902ff3e223444b835fa6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9573cfe6428bdb7c569902ff3e223444b835fa6b/0_28_4096_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a voter in stetson hat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’m pretty sure my undergraduate security class could have changed the outcome of the presidential election,’ the University of Michigan’s J Alex Halderman said.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry W.

The abortive recount didn’t find any evidence that a hack had happened; it just also didn’t find evidence that it hadn’t happened.</p> <h2><strong>Numbers</strong></h2> <p>Even numbers are at risk when the security world gets going. Well, specific kinds of numbers, at least. Jos Wetzels and Ali Abbasi, from the University of Twente in the Netherlands, demonstrated their research on weaknesses in embedded cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators, and it was bad news.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebd510d51fd4d2304b9c66658702149519b9e3b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebd510d51fd4d2304b9c66658702149519b9e3b3/882_0_1624_976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Random numbers are very important for a number of security applications, such as safely encrypting communications\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Random numbers are very important for a number of security applications, such as safely encrypting communications</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernat Armangue/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Let’s break that down. Random numbers are very important for a number of security applications, such as safely encrypting communications. But without specialist, expensive hardware, true random numbers are impossible for a computer to generate, due to the deterministic way they work.</p> <p>Instead, they create pseudo-random numbers: a “good enough” approximation of randomness. Cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators are a subset of that, which fit specific requirements that let them generate random numbers that can be used in a security context. It needs to be impossible to predict what number will come next if you know the number just generated, for instance, and it needs to be impossible to know the previous number generated if you’ve just seen one be generated.</p> <p>In order to fake the randomness, many computers use external sources of data to “seed” the random number generators: information like mouse and keyboard activity, or disk accesses, can set the number generator in a different state each time. But those sources aren’t available in the simple computers used in “embedded” systems, like those powering the internet of things, ATMs and jet fighters.</p> <p>So how do manufacturers solve the problems? As Wetzels and Abbasi showed, the answer is: badly. The pair showed three vendors – including one whose technology is used in jet fighters – whose number generators were anything but cryptographically secure. The scariest thing? The three they decided to show weren’t the worst: they were the best.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Virtual reality is here. You can <a href=\"https://www.evevalkyrie.com/\">pilot a starfighter</a>, make <a href=\"https://www.tiltbrush.com/\">sculptures out of virtual clay</a> and experience <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2016/nov/10/virtual-reality-by-the-guardian#\">award-winning journalism</a> … but can you use it to get some work done? </p> <p>I persuaded my editor to let me give it a go, doing a day’s work living in a virtual world created by the Oculus Rift. </p> <p>I thought I’d come out the other side being able to answer questions like “is this the future?”.</p> <p>Take my advice: do not do what I did.</p> <h2>What I did</h2> <p>Like many people, the majority of my work involves a desktop computing environment and a text editor. This is, I confess, not the best type of work to do in virtual reality. If my job was manipulating 3D objects or visualising complex multidimensional datasets, then maybe I would have been better placed to make the most of transporting myself to a fully computer-generated world for hours on end. But you work with what you’ve got.</p> <p>So my options for the bulk of my work were limited. In the end, I decided to switch between two Oculus apps which give me a view of my own computer desktop, but in virtual space: <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1018613041536358/\">BigScreen</a>, by BigScreen, and <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/911715622255585/\">Virtual Desktop</a>, by Guy Godin. </p> <p>Neither is designed to let a journalist work in a web-based CMS in virtual space (which it turns out is perhaps because that’s a bloody stupid thing to want to do). BigScreen is a screen-sharing app, letting multiple users sit around a massive virtual display. It’s perfect for, for example, watching a movie “with” your partner on another continent, or playing PC games in front of an audience. With a business hat on, I could also see it being useful for giving presentations to an audience dispersed geographically.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0041c44a9c15c0596a1db192633dff61bf8fbb76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0041c44a9c15c0596a1db192633dff61bf8fbb76/0_96_3972_2383/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poised and ready for some real work in virtual reality.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poised and ready for some real work in virtual reality.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Virtual Desktop is more stripped-back, with the sole focus of placing your desktop in front of you in a strange virtual space. There are a few reasons you might want to do that, mostly around the ability to make that virtual desktop really, really big. If you have a dinky monitor, it can be quite cool to play your favourite game on a virtual 100” screen.</p> <p>Both apps let you alter the surrounding environment as well, placing your virtual screen anywhere from a calming savanna to a crackling campfire.</p> <p>That’s perhaps the best thing about doing your work in VR. The ability to look away from your screen and see the sun breaking over a pristine landscape, rather than grey clouds depositing grey rain over a grey industrial estate, is quite pleasant.</p> <p>Unfortunately, everything else isn’t.</p> <h2>Oh god my eyes</h2> <p>The first thing you notice about trying to do actual work in virtual reality is that a host of minor irritations caused by the fact that the real world aren’t there.</p> <p>It’s surprisingly hard to find and use the mouse and keyboard. You probably think you can touch-type. I certainly did. I even have some evidence of that, based on the fact that I used a blank-keyed <a href=\"http://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-ultimate/\">Das Keyboard</a> for a few years. But it turns out that there’s a difference between being able to type without looking at the keyboard and being able to type without being able to see your own hands, even in your peripheral vision. The latter’s quite hard, and it gets even worse the first couple of times you lose the mouse. I had headphones on, so I’m not totally sure, but I’m pretty certain my editor was openly laughing at me banging around the desk trying to find where I’d left my mouse without knocking over my coffee.</p> <p>Not that I needed a cup of coffee, because the Oculus Rift is perfectly shaped to prevent any and all use of cups, mugs and glasses while wearing it. Even if you do manage to grasp it safely, the base of the goggles will stop you from actually drinking unless you perform a dangerous manoeuvre, tilting your head far enough back for the liquid to dribble into your face. I tried it once, but accidentally waterboarded myself and had to stop for fear I would drown myself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cf449716d62407855cdccf8b5ed827d157a8bd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cf449716d62407855cdccf8b5ed827d157a8bd0/311_187_4015_2409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trying to drink while working in VR proves tricky.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trying to drink while working in VR proves tricky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The saving grace is that it’s really helpful to have an excuse to remove the headset every now and again, because the crippling pain in your face will quickly leave you wanting a lie down.</p> <p>When you put the Rift on for the first time, you’re faced with message warning you to “stop use if you experience any discomfort”. The accompanying health and safety guidance goes further, advising you to “take at least a 10 to 15 minute break every 30 minutes, even if you don’t think you need it.”<br /></p> <p>For someone used to ignoring games consoles’ plaintive cry to take 10 minutes every hour, it’s tempting to ignore this advice too. But they aren’t exaggerating. As I headed into my third consecutive hour using the headset, I was keenly aware of pain in my eyes from the strain, in my head from the light and in my face from the headset. I also felt vaguely nauseous, and actually had a brief moment of panic when my forehead went numb, which I don’t think it’s supposed to do.</p> <p>If I hadn’t already promised my editor I would wear the headset for a day, I would have given up at noon, such was the discomfort. As well as the standard problems of using VR for any length of time, I was discovering new, special problems, just for those doing stupid things like me. </p> <p>It turns out that placing a 100-inch virtual monitor in front of you, and then using all hundred inches to display a mostly white webpage, leaves you essentially staring into the white-hot centre of the sun for hours on end. Unlike a real monitor, you cannot look away, and even if you shut your eyes, the light is bright enough to shine through. </p> <p>I ended up alternating between my left eye and my right, so that at least one eye got some rest at any time, and whenever I could, I spun my chair slightly and stared at the calming savanna. After a while, even that wasn’t enough, so I transported myself to the darkest setting possible, a space-scape, but that presented its own problems: staring from deep blackness back into a bright white light is fairly punishing as well.</p> <p>By the afternoon, though, my coping mechanisms had started to work, and I managed to get through the second half of the day with much less physical pain.</p> <h2>A bubble of concentration</h2> <p>There were some upsides, beyond searing masochism. Being able to inject yourself into a little bubble of calm is actually quite efficient, particularly for those of us who work in open-plan offices. Wearing headphones isn’t the “piss off and leave me alone” signal it once was, but if the person you want to chat to is wearing a VR headset as well, you’ll probably just find someone else to bother.</p> <p>That meant that I was more focused on my writing than I have been for a very long time, hammering out a 2,500-word feature over the course of the day. </p> <p>But few of the other gains I was hoping to achieve were possible. Some of that is a question of technical feasibility: for instance, I was hoping I’d be able to create multiple virtual monitors, with a high resolution and the freedom to place them anywhere I wanted. Imagine being able to glance over your shoulder to check the news, for instance.</p> <p>That’ll come soon, but for now neither app I used was able to offer that as a feature, in part because of the way they pull your real desktop into virtual space. More fundamental problems, though, lie in the interaction with the world, particularly if you need to use text entry.</p> <p>While a keyboard and mouse are the best options for dealing with large amounts of text, touch controllers like the Oculus Touch are the best options for navigating a virtual world. Unfortunately, moving between the two is hard, because you can’t see where they are. Cue yet more patting the area around you, trying not to knock anything over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"318a1f36c2ae6f8214e84acd5c74b591eb2dc07c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/318a1f36c2ae6f8214e84acd5c74b591eb2dc07c/513_0_3955_2373/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Using VR to work may not be the best look.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Using VR to work may not be the best look.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There’s also the problem that a massive screen isn’t actually all that useful, particularly if the actual resolution is capped at the same as your normal desktop. There’s only so many times you can stare up and to your right to close a window before you just want to shrink the screen a bit.</p> <p>If you do shrink the screen, though, you get the other problem: the resolution of modern VR headsets is terrible. Text is only legible if it’s blown up fairly large, and even then, you aren’t going to be reading anything in complicated fonts or a language with an unfamiliar character set. This, more than anything else, is why I ended up with a splitting headache. It felt like reading drunk.</p> <p>For other jobs, though, it’s far clearer that some form of VR is the future. You don’t need to use <a href=\"https://www.tiltbrush.com/\">Tilt Brush</a>, Google’s 3D painting app, for long to realise that it could be a gamechanger for those who work with 3D modelling. And if you do need to visualise complex information, virtual reality is an obvious way forward.</p> <p>But for the foreseeable future, even those careers may struggle due to the lack of a general computing environment in any shipping VR system. Unless you can do 100% of your work within one app, a virtual desktop proposition is still the best option for getting stuff done in VR: multitasking between apps is nonexistent, and even rapidly switching apps isn’t really possible today. That means that, for instance, a floating browser window with some visual reference to help you accurately model in Tilt Brush, or a text-entry box alongside your fancy 3D visualisation, require the app maker to serve your specific needs.</p> <p>That’s trickier than simply fixing VR so it doesn’t leave you in pain after extended use, although admittedly not as urgent. It requires a fundamental re-imagining of what the job of a VR platform actually is, and it will also lead to multiple abortive attempts to come up with some sort of user interface standard for this before someone cracks it. </p> <p>When they do, I’ll be ready. Though maybe, this time, not first in line.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>For those who see the cinema as the last refuge from mobile phones, rumours about Apple’s latest squeeze on our attention spans will be alarming. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sonnydickson?lang=en\">Sonny Dickson</a>, a longtime Apple news leaker, tweeted that iPhones could have a “theatre mode”. People have speculated that this could be silent notifications and a dark screen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/04/turn-it-on-future-iphones-and-ipads-to-have-theatre-mode-for-use-in-cinemas\">Turn it on! Future iPhones and iPads to have \\'theatre mode\\' for use in cinemas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In one sense, says Jane Crowther, editor of Total Film, it might be a good thing. “People are incapable of not looking at their phones in cinemas,” she says, and anything that stops bright white rectangular screens stabbing the darkness would help. But it would also legitimise their use: “‘I’ve got it in theatre mode so I can look at my emails or Instagram.’ But there are people who go to the movies to really take note of everything that happens and it’s really distracting to have someone, even with a darker screen, [on their phone] next to you.”</p> <p>Terri White, editor of Empire, agrees. “I find it absolute madness that anybody would want to do anything other than turn their phone off. You can’t fully give yourself over to a film and lose yourself in the moment, which is the amazing thing about cinema, if your phone’s buzzing on your thigh.”</p> <p>The Guardian’s film critic Peter Bradshaw gets annoyed if people use their phone as a torch while trying to find their seat. “People rake the auditorium. I have been dazzled by the torch of some guy who’s come back from the loo.” Bradshaw was once a torchbearer. “I was called out online for using my phone – or rather the glow from my screen – to make notes by. People found that annoying and I thought: ‘Yeah, they’re right.’”</p> <p>There have been attempts to get people to loosen up about phones in cinemas. In April 2016, the CEO of American cinema chain AMC suggested that asking a 22-year-old to turn off their phone was like asking them to “cut off your left arm above the elbow” and he raised the possibility of phone-friendly screenings. But the outcry could not have been greater had he suggested that people urinate in the aisles (<a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/amc-u-turns-texting-theaters-now-%E2%80%98cutting-room-floor%E2%80%99\">AMC backtracked</a>).</p> <p>“Almost every time I see a film I end up hissing at someone to turn their phone off,” an otherwise even-tempered colleague tells me. “Once it was someone I was on a date with. Another time I was settling down to watch all four hours of Lars von Trier’s Nymphomaniac when a woman in the row in front started texting. I sidled up behind and hissed at her to turn it off and she nearly jumped out of her seat. If you’re at the cinema, you’re participating in a social occasion in which the golden rule is not to spoil the film for others.”</p>',\n",

During a previous project, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://cvdazzle.com/\">CV Dazzle</a>, he attempted to create an aesthetic of makeup and hairstyling that would cause machines to be unable to detect a face. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"396302866244e3539e54bc5571e27fb512f1e59f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/396302866244e3539e54bc5571e27fb512f1e59f/62_0_885_531/500.png\" alt=\"Two models wearing CV Dazzle styling.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two models wearing CV Dazzle styling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Harvey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking at the Chaos Communications Congress hacking conference in Hamburg, Harvey said: “As I’ve looked at in an earlier project, you can change the way you appear, but, in camouflage you can think of the figure and the ground relationship. There’s also an opportunity to modify the ‘ground’, the things that appear next to you, around you, and that can also modify the computer vision confidence score.”</p> <p>Harvey’s Hyperface project aims to do just that, he says, “overloading an algorithm with what it wants, oversaturating an area with faces to divert the gaze of the computer vision algorithm.”</p> <p>The resultant patterns, which Harvey created <a href=\"http://www.hyphen-labs.com/index.html\">in conjunction with international interaction studio Hyphen-Labs</a>, can be worn or used to blanket an area. “It can be used to modify the environment around you, whether it’s someone next to you, whether you’re wearing it, maybe around your head or in a new way.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edf31ce6317784333ffb2ec83adab501ce78fac8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edf31ce6317784333ffb2ec83adab501ce78fac8/31_0_711_400/500.png\" alt=\"An example of a Hyperface textile pattern.\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An example of a Hyperface textile pattern.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Harvey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Explaining his hopes for how technologies like his would affect the world, Harvey showed an image of a street scene from the 1910s, pointing out that every figure in it is wearing a hat. “In 100 years from now, we’re going to have a similar transformation of fashion and the way that we appear. What will that look like? Hopefully it will look like something that appears to optimise our personal privacy.”</p> <p>To emphasise the extent to which facial recognition technology changes expectations of privacy, Harvey collated 47 different data points commercial and academic researchers claim to be able to discover from a 100x100 pixel facial image – around 2.5% of the size of a typical Instagram photo. Those include traits such as “calm” or “kind”, criminal tendencies like “paedophile” or “white collar offender”, and simple demographics like “age” and “gender”.</p> <p>Research from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, for instance, claims to be able to predict criminality from lip curvature, eye inner corner distance and the so-called nose-mouth angle.</p> <p>“A lot of other researchers are looking at how to take that very small data and turn it into insights that can be used for marketing,” Harvey said. “What all this reminds me of is Francis Galton and eugenics. The real criminal, in these cases, are people who are perpetrating this idea, not the people who are being looked at.”</p> <p>Harvey and Hyphen-Labs plan to reveal details on the Hyperface project this month, as part of Hyphen-Labs’ new work NeuroSpeculative AfroFeminism.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Mark Zuckerberg has given more weight to the idea that he could move into politics with the announcement of a statesmanly personal challenge for 2017.</p> <p>In previous years the Facebook CEO has learned Mandarin, pledged to run at least a mile each day and built a virtual assistant called Jarvis to control his home. This year he wants to have visited and met people in every state in the US. He’s already visited about 20 states, which means he has to travel to about 30 states by the end of the year.</p> <p>“After a tumultuous last year, my hope for this challenge is to get out and talk to more people about how they’re living, working and thinking about the future,” he said in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103385178272401?pnref=story\">Facebook post</a> announcing the challenge.</p> <p>“For decades, technology and globalization have made us more productive and connected. This has created many benefits, but for a lot of people it has also made life more challenging. This has contributed to a greater sense of division than I have felt in my lifetime. We need to find a way to change the game so it works for everyone.”</p> <p>He said that his journey around the country would involve road trips with his wife Priscilla Chan, visits to Facebook offices, meetings with teachers and scientists, and stops in small towns and universities. </p> <p>“I’m looking forward to this challenge and I hope to see you out there!” he told the Facebook community, which now has 1.79 billion members. </p> <p>It’s the latest in a string of moves that indicate Zuckerberg’s intention to pursue government service. In early December, unsealed court filings from a class-action lawsuit filed in April revealed that Zuckerberg and two board members had discussed how the CEO might pursue a political career while retaining control of Facebook. </p> <p>Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, one of the company’s most prominent investors, texted Zuckerberg in March to say that the “biggest issue” of the corporate proposal was “how to define the gov’t service thing without freaking out shareholders that you are losing commitment”.</p> <p>On Christmas Day, the Facebook CEO revealed that he is no longer an atheist, one of the biggest liabilities a presidential candidate can have, <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2012/07/26/2012-romney-mormonism-obamas-religion/\">according to research by Pew Research Center</a>. In a cheery update he said: “Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah from Priscilla, Max, Beast and me,” referring to his wife, daughter and dog.</p> <p>Below the post a commenter asked “aren’t you an atheist?” – Zuckerberg used to declare <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119621309736406034\">his lack of faith on his Facebook profile</a> – to which he replied: “No. I was raised Jewish and then I went through a period where I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important.”</p> <p>Zuckerberg has already dipped his toe into politics with the 2013 launch of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/11/mark-zuckerberg-launches-immigration-group\">lobby group Fwd.us</a> to support immigration reform and expand the H1B visa program, which is widely used in Silicon Valley to hire skilled foreign workers. He had also been ramped up his philanthropic efforts with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, through which he planned to spend $3bn to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/21/mark-zuckerberg-priscilla-chan-end-disease\">“cure, prevent or manage all diseases”</a>.</p> <p>At the same time, Zuckerberg has tried to avoid the appearance of political bias, even as his company has sunk deeper into political controversies, culminating in the accusations that Facebook’s failure to tackle fake news <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-fake-news-election-conspiracy-theories\">somehow influenced the outcome of the US presidential election</a>. </p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>A couple whose five-year-old daughter was killed after a distracted driver drove into their car is suing Apple for failing to introduce an iPhone safety feature it patented in 2014 to discourage people from using FaceTime while driving.</p> <p>The lawsuit, filed in Santa Clara superior county court, relates to an incident that took place on Christmas Eve 2014, when a driver allegedly using the FaceTime video chat application on his iPhone 6 Plus drove into the car of Bethany and James Modisette. The couple, along with their daughters Isabella and Moriah, were injured in the accident, and Moriah later died in the hospital from her injuries.</p> <p>In their complaint, <a href=\"http://courthousenews.com/family-sues-apple-over-wreck-caused-by-facetime/\">highlighted by Courthouse News</a>, the Modisettes claim that Apple should be held accountable for the accident because the smartphone manufacturer had a patent for a safer version of FaceTime designed to prevent people from using the video and voice call application while driving. </p> <p>Despite filing the patent, Apple chose not to introduce the technology to its iPhones. The patent in question, granted in April 2014, describes a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/24/apples-iphone-lock-out-patent-could-end-texting-while-driving\">lock-out mechanism</a> that disables the mobile device from performing certain functions, such as texting, while driving.</p> <p>The Modisettes <a href=\"http://courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/FaceTime.pdf\">allege</a> that Apple’s failure to introduce the patented feature, or warn users that using FaceTime while driving could be dangerous, was a “substantial factor” in causing their injuries and Moriah’s death.</p> <p>The case is not the first of its kind. Earlier this year, while checking her iPhone for messages, Ashley Kubiak <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/technology/phone-makers-could-cut-off-drivers-so-why-dont-they.html?_r=0\">crashed her truck</a> into another vehicle in Texas, killing its driver and leaving a child paralyzed. The families of the victims also filed a case against Apple, contending the company knew its phones would be used for texting and did not prevent Kubiak from texting dangerously. </p> <p>Kubiak was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to five years on probation.</p> <p>“Plaintiffs are saying to manufacturers: if your product unnecessarily diverts the driver’s attention away from the road in the moment before a collision, you may be on the hook,” said Nora Freeman Engstrom, a Stanford law professor. </p> <p>“If the plaintiffs were to prevail, the case could have sweeping implications, not just for handheld devices, but for navigation systems, car radios – potentially even fast food purchased at drive-through windows.”</p> <p>However, it will be difficult for the plaintiffs to show that it was the iPhone that caused the accident when there is another actor – the distracted driver – who could be labelled as a “superseding cause”.</p> <p>“A superseding cause breaks the causal chain, and here would relieve the iPhone manufacturer of liability,” Engstrom said.</p> <p>A complicating factor in both of these cases is that the accidents took place in Texas, where it’s mostly legal for drivers to <a href=\"http://www.txdot.gov/driver/laws/cellphones.html\">make phone calls</a> while driving and there’s no state-wide <a href=\"http://www.jrlawfirm.com/blog/texas-texting-and-driving-laws-by-city/\">ban on texting while driving</a>, although many cities have outlawed the practice.</p> <p>“Ordinarily if a manufacturer is being sued for an illegal use of their product, they shouldn’t be liable,” said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University school of law.</p> <p>However, if the company knew that its devices could be used illegally and had a way to prevent it, there may be grounds for liability – although such liability would hinge on whether the technical solution (in this case, the patented lock-out feature) was feasible.</p> <p>“There’s currently no way to determine whether or not the person using the phone is driving. They could be the passenger,” said patent lawyer Mark Terry. “I don’t think they have a sound legal premise.</p> <p>“A tragedy has happened and they are looking for a deep pocket. Apple has a deep pocket so if anyone can find a reason to hit them at all, they will,” he added.</p> <p>Goldman agrees. “This is what personal injury lawyers do,” he said.</p> <p>“They sue not only the person who caused the harm – the driver – and then everyone else they can think of who might have contributed to the accident.”</p> <p>That’s not to say that cases like these won’t cause problems for device manufacturers in the future.</p> <p> “The patent proves that Apple knows, and has long known, that phone use and driving is widespread and is dangerous,” Engstrom said. “Apple’s inaction in the face of that knowledge may not trigger liability here. But it may well expose Apple to liability down the road.”</p> <p>Apple did not respond to a request for comment.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Airbnb may be known for offering frugal travellers savings over traditional hotels, but a new investigation reveals that a lot of the savings the company can offer in the UK come not from fancy technology, but tax advantages.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73102c20-c60e-11e6-9043-7e34c07b46ef\">the Financial Times</a>, around one third of the savings the company offers customers on accommodation in London comes from having a lower tax bill.</p> <p>Where a traditional hotel has to pay expensive business rates on its property, and charge VAT on the entire cost of its stay, individuals and small businesses who let out rooms on Airbnb have a much lighter taxation regime: the service only charges VAT on its service fees, not on the bulk of the cash transferred from guest to host, and homeowners <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/sirajdatoo/rent-a-room-on-airbnb-for-longer-tax-free?utm_term=.mbEeKbMyn#.lfzOrdejJ\">are recipients of a number of tax breaks aimed at encouraging them to take on lodgers</a>. Larger UK businesses are also levied VAT, but only when their revenue tops £83,000, something only the largest Airbnb hosts achieve.</p> <p>The average hotel room price included $41.30 (£33.60) a night in tax, according to the FT’s figures, whereas the average Airbnb stay was just $8.40. That difference would account for a third of the difference between the typical hotel cost and Airbnb room.</p> <p>In a statement given to the FT, Airbnb said “The overwhelming amount of money generated by the Airbnb platform stays with hosts and their communities. The Airbnb model is unique and empowers regular people, boosts local communities and is subject to local tax. It also makes Airbnb fundamentally different to hotel groups and companies that take large sums of money out of the places they do business.”</p> <p>Airbnb has faced criticism from competitors for the laissez-faire attitude with which it treats hosts. The Bed and Breakfast Association has attacked the company for not requiring hotel-standard fire protection (it does not require hosts to fit smoke alarms, for instance, nor oblige them to document emergency exits).</p> <p>From spring 2017, Airbnb is to introduce at least one new regulation for its users, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/01/airbnb-introduces-90-day-a-year-limit-for-london-hosts\">requiring them to comply with UK laws</a> that limit the period of time a home can be let out to 90 days in one year unless council permission is granted. Previously, Airbnb had required councils to independently enforce the laws, even though it held the data required to prove breaches.</p> <p>“We want to help ensure that home-sharing grows responsibly and sustainably, and makes London’s communities stronger,” the company said when it introduced the change. “That is why we are introducing a change to our platform that will create new and automated limits to help ensure that entire home listings in London are not shared for more than 90 days a year, unless hosts confirm that they have permission to share their space more frequently.”</p> <p>The enforcement won’t come cheap. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3bedf28e-c63d-11e6-8f29-9445cac8966f\">Financial Times estimates</a> the company could lose out on $400m worth of bookings a year through implementing the limit. Airbnb in a statement said, “the analysis by the Financial Times is wrong and is based on false data and flawed methodology”.</p>',\n",

From new wireless earbuds to virtual assistants built into speakers a lot of what we saw seemed like a glimpse of a better future. But what if someone actually made the tech we dream of?

What better way to wake up in the morning than walking out of the shower through a human-sized Airblade? From soaking to super in just five seconds. Make it happen, Sir James.</p> <h2>A fitness band that makes you fit just by wearing it</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"565c2b185ac3d027bb93be997cbe17f5bf600f77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/565c2b185ac3d027bb93be997cbe17f5bf600f77/0_87_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Getting fit in 2017 could look like this\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Getting fit in 2017 could look like this</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fitness bands have long promised a revolution in public health, but simply tracking your steps or your heart rate is not really making the strides one might hope. Surely a true smart fitness band would do all the work for you so you don’t actually have to do anything. Maybe by firing tiny electric pulses or something – there must be a way. Slap it on, press a button and be transformed into Brad Pitt in Fight Club.</p> <h2>Self-walking shoes</h2> <p>Self-driving cars will be great, but what about that last mile? You step out of the car, train, plane or bus and, what, you have to manually walk to your destination. Hoverboards exploded, so let’s count them out, but what about shoes that know where they’re going? All you’d have to do is take the first step and the shoes will do the rest – leaving you safe to stare down at your phone without fear of walking into a lamppost.</p> <h2>Waterproof laptops</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaf92face9ef2b0159998001fb456088cbd0f3cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaf92face9ef2b0159998001fb456088cbd0f3cd/0_1023_4281_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"laptop in a coffee shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It’s fine, this one is waterproof, right?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hinterhaus Productions/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Waterproof smartphones have been a thing for a few years now. There have even been a few waterproof tablets, but why not waterproof laptops? Coffee, beer, wine and vodka gets spilled on laptops just as much as tablets and smartphones. You (probably) can’t drop a laptop down the toilet, but you can douse it in your quad-venti soy latte with hazelnut syrup and whipped cream just as easily as you can your phone. Fixing this one is simple.

Because with Donald Trump in the White House, the world needs a real-life Iron Man with all the trimmings.</p> <h2>Synthahol, the alcohol you can take a pill to get rid of</h2> <p>Silicon Valley has attempted to solve the problem of the human need for food with a liquid mulch called Soylent – which eventually made people sick. But there’s a first-world problem that needs solving and Sci-Fi has promised a solution for decades. Where is the alcohol substitute that you can drink, be happy and merry but then take a pill and be genuinely sober within minutes so you can just drive home at the end of the night? They have this in Star Trek, so why not in 2017?</p> <h2>Just one more thing, an iPhone with a battery that lasts a day</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52c8f2c7019b91931a19d540ae1d29eddb81ca06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52c8f2c7019b91931a19d540ae1d29eddb81ca06/0_0_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 6S showing a low battery symbol, a not uncommon sight.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">iPhone 6S showing a low battery symbol, a not uncommon sight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>OK, OK so we know this one is pure fantasy, but indulge us.

That week she handed in her resignation. </p> <p>Chelsea is one of a growing number of Australian women making a living from <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/\">Twitch.tv</a>, a live-video streaming platform that allows people from all over the world to watch one another play games. It’s also a social network: chat rooms are embedded into user pages next to video streams, allowing the broadcaster and audience to interact in real time. Going by the username Xminks, Chelsea has become renowned for her skills in Call of Duty – so much so that playing it online has become her bread and butter. Every night about 10pm she turns on her webcam, chats to some of her 330,000 followers and gets to work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/20/gamergate-internet-toughest-game-woman-enemies\">Gamergate: the internet is the toughest game in town – if you’re playing as a woman | Charlie Brooker</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Twitch has somehow escaped becoming a household name despite its phenomenal popularity: the company claims it has 9.7 million active users on its site every day and more than 2 million streamers a month. Amazon saw its potential in 2014 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/26/amazon-buys-video-streaming-website-twitch-1bn-dollars\">bought it for $970m</a>, even though the decision left many business commentators scratching their heads at the time.</p> <p>The company doesn’t only deal in online interactions: it also livestreams some of the world’s biggest video game tournaments, in which professional gamers compete in stadiums in front of thousands of people and millions of online viewers. Audiences for game tournaments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/15/esports-mainstream-media-bbc-sky-dota-2-league-of-legends\">routinely surpass those of mainstream television</a> – yet somehow the scene manages to retain the illusion of being a subculture.</p> <p>While a tiny number of gamers become tournament megastars, more garden-variety streamers make their money through fan donations and sponsorships. Popular streamers are offered the option of partnering with Twitch to install a subscriptions feature on their page, which gives users the opportunity to pay a fee of US$4.99 a month to the streamer’s channel. Twitch, of course, takes a slice, but half the subscription fee goes directly to the streamer and most users subscribe to support their favourite gamers.</p> <p>“It becomes a base salary for streamers, instead of just relying on tips, which one month could be $100, which next month could be $4,000 – you never know,” says Mia. She is a relative newcomer to the world of livestreaming. Although she has been playing games since she was kid, she only discovered Twitch about 18 months ago, through an online friend. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af7a720612c57282d72e72767ae448bf232ce5df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af7a720612c57282d72e72767ae448bf232ce5df/0_71_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gamer silhouettes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Like much of the online world, streamers and their followers are often anonymous.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Johannessen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I didn’t have gamer friends … and it’s not something that you would just stumble across,” she explains. “When I found Twitch and saw that so many people have all these friends and were doing amazing things and sharing their experience together, I just really wanted to get on board.”</p> <p>Mia, whose screen name is SeriesofBlurs, dived straight in. “I was working my normal full-time job and then I would come home and start streaming straight away … and then go to midnight and then repeat,” she says.</p> <p>She knew very quickly that she wanted to become a full-time streamer, but building up a following while holding down another job was hard. Then there were the social implications. “I would constantly be having to defend it, not only to my friends, who were like, ‘Why aren’t you coming out?,’ but to myself as well, because I had a lot of self-doubt.”</p> <p>Being a professional gamer sounds like a dream come true and an increasing number of Australian women are making it their profession – many of them using Twitch as a platform, making anywhere between the equivalent of the minimum wage to hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. </p> <p>Whether or not it can be a decades-long career, though, remains to be seen. While there are numerous men whose live gaming careers seem not to be hampered by their age, the number of women over the age of 30 visible in the gaming sphere is comparatively low. <br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Growing up in a girls’ school, it wasn’t really common to be into video games</p> <footer> <cite>Mia</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“It depends on the game,” says Chelsea. “I’ve seen some Sim City and Civilisation games, and I’ve seen older women there, but it’s very rare.”</p> <p>Kat, whose username is Loserfruit, is another high-profile Australian gamer with about 240,000 followers on Twitch. “It is a dream job,” she says. “It’s a lot of money for playing games. It is a dream. So it would be kind of hard to go away from that. So I would like to be doing it as long as possible until I burn out. But I am open to and I’m exploring other things as well.”</p> <p>Like much of the online world, streamers and their followers are often known only by their first name or chosen on-screen handle. This semi-anonymity is both a boon and a burden for female gamers. Harassment often comes via a pseudonym. At the same time, to protect themselves, some women deliberately keep their personal details, such as their surname and location, even their age, out of the equation. Guardian Australia is using only first names and screen handles in this piece for that reason.<br /></p> <p>Mia, Chelsea and Kat are positive about their career choice. “As long as I keep putting effort in, I foresee that I could do it for the next five or 10 years at least,” says Chelsea.</p> <p>Mia says: “At the end of the day, I’m doing what I love.”<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df15d15b7263a85ccfeb1ce0337654aca71bf3ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df15d15b7263a85ccfeb1ce0337654aca71bf3ec/0_0_2362_1575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea gaming and livestreaming on Twitch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chelsea gaming and livestreaming on Twitch.

But despite being among a growing number of visible, high-profile women in professional gaming, all the women Guardian Australia spoke to had something else in common, too: a sense of isolation.</p> <p>The gaming industry markets itself unequivocally as a boys’ club. As a consequence, women’s entry into this space is accompanied by dangerously loaded assumptions from a chunk of their male audience.<br /></p> <p>“I feel like being a gamer has always isolated me,” Mia says. “Growing up in a girls’ school, it wasn’t really common to be into video games.”<br /></p> <p>Chelsea remembers having similar feelings. “I would always be so excited for my friends to leave so I could sit down at my computer and play games all night,” she says. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/28/my-dream-to-become-pro-gamer-ended-in-utter-failure\">Why my dream of becoming a pro gamer ended in utter failure</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She didn’t tell her friends about her gaming at first. “It was a thing that I kept on the lowdown. It wasn’t so much shame, it’s just I felt like [they] wouldn’t understand it the way that people who play the games do.” </p> <p>Kat says: “I had a few good girlfriends that did play games in high school but they kind of grew out of it. And I guess that was the thing: they grew out of it and I never did.”</p> <p>It was boys who introduced Kat to gaming. “I had boy cousins, older boy cousins, and you just can’t help it. If they’re playing it, you want to play too.”</p> <p>But if half the gaming population is female, how could a generation of female gamers grow up knowing so few other women who play?</p> <p>“It’s no accident that most video game retailers plaster their walls with promotional posters for action games, shooters and war games,” <a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed\">writes Tracey Lien</a> in a piece for the online magazine Polygon. </p> <p>Lien explains how in 1983, the video game market spectacularly collapsed, largely as a result of being flooded with sub-par product. An industry that was, until then, largely gender-neutral, and included many women at both the executive and development levels, began scrabbling around for a way out of a financial hole. Lien writes that after the crash, “the game industry’s pursuit of a safe and reliable market led to it homing in on the young male. And so the advertising campaigns began. Video games were heavily marketed as products for men and the message was clear: no girls allowed.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85c2b68af498d2fbe2ea43c945827c37d8162011\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85c2b68af498d2fbe2ea43c945827c37d8162011/0_0_2362_1575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The computer screen of professional gamer Chelsea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Every night about 10pm in Australia, Chelsea turns on her webcam, chats to some of her 330,000 followers and gets to work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Lewis for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Australian game developer Leena Van Deventer argues that the effects of this gendered mass marketing is most obvious in the current generation of 20- and 30-something gamers. “Women have always been there,” she says. “Women were instrumental in the birth of games and tech but our generation is still very much dealing with the hangover of being told it’s not for us and the result that has had in our institutions and in our culture.”</p> <p>In other words, if a generation of women grew up thinking they didn’t know any female gamers, it was because they had been cowed into silence by a culture that repeatedly told them games were not for them. </p> <p>Nowhere is this more obvious than in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/11/gamergate-a-brief-history-of-a-computer-age-war\">the development of Gamergate</a> – a largely anonymous online harassment campaign, involving rape and death threats, which focused on discrediting a number of women in the gaming community, including the developers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/11/gamergate-a-brief-history-of-a-computer-age-war\">Zoe Quinn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/17/brianna-wu-gamergate-human-cost\">Brianna Wu</a> and the critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/15/anita-sarkeesian-feminist-games-critic-cancels-talk\">Anita Sarkeesian</a>. It demonstrated, more than anything, that there are deep pockets of vitriol in the gaming world reserved especially for women. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are some weird things that streamers get asked to do, like sending panties</p> <footer> <cite>Kat</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“Women’s appearance plays a bigger role [in their success] than their actual gameplay,” Chelsea says. “Whereas men’s appearance, it does not matter if their gameplay is amazing.”</p> <p>And when it comes to making money, there are added expectations. “I was really worried about getting donations because of what would be requested,” Kat says. She started streaming while she was at university studying journalism. Her connection was low quality – “I don’t even know how people saw me through the pixels” – but it was enough to allow her to build a strong following which resulted in some very generous donations.</p> <p>“There are some weird things that streamers get asked to do, like sending panties – people email and ask for that,” she says. “Or like, pictures of their feet in exchange for money.”</p> <h2>‘All of a sudden I’m a cam girl?’</h2> <p>The women on Twitch don’t see themselves as pornographers or sex workers – far from it – but that doesn’t mean there aren’t audience members who feel they are owed more than witty banter and good gameplay, particularly if they are handing over cash.<br /></p> <p>“The way some people treat you because you’re a woman on the internet is disgusting,” Kat says. “They think they can just give you money and expect certain things or just say something in chat and expect something – for you to take your clothes off and that sort of stuff. There are people who actually think that’s how it works.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have a legit career as a gamer and you can’t take me seriously as a gamer?</p> <footer> <cite>Mia</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It’s no secret that porn is one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2002/mar/03/internetnews.observerfocus\">the primary drivers of technological innovation</a>, but there are a striking number of structural similarities between Twitch and some forms of online pornography. And it is women who bear the brunt of the association.</p> <p>“I had one of my friends make a joke about me being a cam girl and I got really, really offended about it,” says Mia. “Not because I think there’s anything wrong with [being a cam girl], but what I am doing is very different … Like, I have a legit career as a gamer and you can’t take me seriously as a gamer? You see me on camera and all of a sudden I’m a cam girl?”</p> <p>The fact that Twitch now seems to be borrowing features from porn-site architecture only increases the association. New features on Twitch called “cheers” – animated emojis purchased by viewers as tips and sent as chat messages – closely resemble functions on the webcam porn platform Chaturbate, in which livestreaming video performers are paid through tips, and use apps to set tip goals and associated “rewards”. </p> <p>But there are points of resistance. At a platform level, Twitch does give users some control, allowing streamers to ban abusive or unwanted users from interacting with them in chat. And, in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/29/twitch-lays-bare-policy-naked-sexually-suggestive-users\">the company banned both male and female users from appearing topless on cam</a> or dressing “suggestively”, in what might arguably be a corporate intervention into a culture of expectation – or perhaps, a move to protect its brand.</p> <p>At a grassroots level, though, women streamers have started banding together to help each other navigate the volatile space of online gaming. </p> <p>“It’s really important to me to try to help [other streamers] out,” Chelsea says. “Because I know it’s super hard when you first start and it’s really overwhelming.” </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/11/gaming-goes-pro-meet-one-of-australias-top-league-of-legends-teams\">Gaming goes pro: meet one of Australia\\'s top League of Legends teams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sometimes it is surreptitious. “There’s definitely like, a secret girls’ club, where we all just know each other and we’ve always kind of lurked each other’s stream,” says Kat.</p> <p>For those interested in a ready-made community, there’s <a href=\"http://widgetau.org/\">Widget</a> – a not-for-profit feminist organisation with more than 650 members, set up to support women in games, development and technology. Established in 2013 and operating mainly through a Facebook group, Widget provides everything from moral support to fundraising assistance for members experiencing domestic violence and financial hardship.<br /></p> <p>But some women just do it the old-fashioned way: by seeking out kindred spirits.</p> <p>“We call it a stream team,” Mia says. “And basically it’s four girls from all over the world and if we need advice or something weird is happening, which occasionally it does, we just ask each other … we’re just there for each other.”<br /></p>',\n",

It is absolutely necessary,” the billionaire PayPal founder Peter Thiel said at a <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/7577391\">2009 seasteading conference</a>.</p> <p> After Thiel helped <a href=\"http://www.seasteading.org/2008/04/introducing-the-seasteading-institute/\">launch the Seasteading Institute</a> with a $500,000 investment, seasteading became the <a href=\"http://archive.wired.com/science/planetearth/news/2008/05/seasteading?currentPage=all\">movement</a> of the moment in Silicon Valley, where regulation and government bureaucracy are anathema and the billionaire’s success as an investor – his current fortune is largely due to his early stake in Facebook – has given him the reputation of a visionary.</p> <p> The logistical and financial challenges of establishing a colony in international waters, however, proved steep. So this year the Seasteading Institute began <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-seasteading-institute-2016-9\">negotiations</a> with French Polynesia, which is a part of France, but has significant autonomy.</p> <p> On 30 November, French Polynesia’s cabinet gave president Edouard Fritch a <a href=\"http://www.presidence.pf/index.php/cm/3265-conseil-des-ministres-du-30-novembre-2016\">mandate</a>, and he will travel to San Francisco in January to sign an agreement to develop a “special governing framework” for “seazones”, according to Randolph Hencken, the Seasteading Institute’s executive director.</p> <p>Hencken said by email that the agreement stipulated that the institute must prove that seasteading will provide economic benefits and not harm the environment, and that the government will not provide any subsidies.</p> <p> “Our seasteading collaboration with French Polynesia was initiated by the Tahitians themselves and will bring jobs, economic growth, and environmental resiliency to the region,” Hencken said.</p> <p> Hencken predicts a close relationship between the seastead and the islands. In an interview with <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-seasteading-institute-2016-9\">Business Insider</a> in October, he suggested that he would be able to take a speedboat to French Polynesia to take yoga classes and go to restaurants. The islands would also provide a construction base, he said, further reducing costs.</p> <p> While Hencken argued that seasteading would be a boon for French Polynesia, exemption from taxes is a key factor in the seasteading movement.</p> <p> In his 2009 speech, Thiel argued that “anything that can be done to create much larger numbers of countries will be very good”, largely because the proliferation of nations would drive down marginal tax rates.</p> <p> “If we want to increase freedom, we want to increase the number of countries.” </p> <p>It is that attitude that draws the suspicion of local residents like Taliercio, who questioned whether “facilitating the tax evasion of the world’s greatest fortunes” would be healthy for South Pacific nations.</p> <p> “I grew up in what is for the rest of the world a terrestrial paradise, but I can testify today that the other side of the picture is not glorious and makes me sad,” Taliercio said. “The unemployment rate is distressing; the impoverishment of the population is palpable everywhere; our social protection system is in deficit and is in peril.”</p> <p> Indeed, French Polynesia’s GDP is just $5.6bn, or about the equivalent of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/peter-thiel/\">two Peter Thiels</a>.</p> <p> Alexandre Le Quéré, a Tahitian radio journalist, poked fun at the idea on <a href=\"http://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/polynesie/emissions-radio/le-plus-de-l-info/iles-artificielles-vrai-projet-delire-futuriste-01122016-422401.html\">Polynésie 1ère</a>, a local media outlet. He quipped that proponents of the “futuristic delirium” of seasteading wanted a “Noah’s Ark to the Wall Street gravy”. Le Quéré also expressed concern that the project could produce “chaos” for the local population.</p> <p> Hervé Raimana Lallemant-Moe, a researcher in international and environmental law at the Université de la Polynésie Française, pointed out that the island nation was “particularly vulnerable” due to its isolation, size, economy, and the threat of climate change, and that the population was generally opposed to large projects on environmental grounds.</p> <p> “It is clear that the people do not think that the creation of artificial islands should be a priority,” he said.</p> <p>The president’s office declined to comment on the plan to the Guardian, but a <a href=\"http://www.presidence.pf/index.php/cm/3265-conseil-des-ministres-du-30-novembre-2016\">statement</a> cited the potential for economic development as a benefit to the country. The government also mentioned the importance of “the presence of serious investors” and named Thiel as a backer.</p> <p>Thiel’s spokesman told the Guardian that he was not “involved in the French Polynesia seasteading efforts”.</p> <p> Marc Collins, a Tahitian businessman and former minister of tourism, said that the negative reaction to the project was to be expected.</p> <p> “Tahitians are sick and tired and hearing of these mega, massive projects that go nowhere,” he said. “There is a predisposition of the population to be very cautious.”</p> <p> </p> <p>But Collins, who invited the Seasteading Institute to consider French Polynesia after reading about the group’s attempts to find a host country in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/05/silicon-valley-letting-go-techie-island-fantasies/\">Wired</a>, said he believed the project was in the best interest of his country, was much smaller than the mega-projects, and would not involve government subsidies. </p> <p> Collins hopes that the seastead will boost the economy, bring the country into more contact with technological innovators in Silicon Valley, and help combat the “brain drain” that sees educated Tahitians leave the islands in search of work.</p> <p> “If anyone knows how to live on the oceans it’s Tahitians,” he said. “Polynesians are the original seasteaders.”</p>',\n",

For the first 18 months of its public operation, Monzo has been limited in what it can offer customers by British banking regulations, forcing it to operate as little more than a pre-paid debit card with a (very slick) app.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8ea8ff8491d61cf6d75d815128a971893e24ad5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8ea8ff8491d61cf6d75d815128a971893e24ad5/0_607_4048_2429/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Monzo beta card in wallet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Monzo beta card.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Hern for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But early next year, Monzo should receive a full banking licence, allowing it to operate as the main bank account for users who want to switch their financial life over to a startup wholesale. Crucially, the license gives it access to the direct debit and faster payments system, allowing users to pay bills from their Monzo accounts – and be paid into their accounts.</p> <p>The banking licence also means the company can start making money for the first time. Users will be able to request an overdraft facility on their Monzo current accounts, with the fees paid being the first revenue the startup will pull in. In the long term, though, don’t expect it to settle for overdraft fees: Monzo wants to be Facebook for money.</p> <h2><strong>Thread</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d6baa1f39b396540ea754c22e2e213decfe84b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d6baa1f39b396540ea754c22e2e213decfe84b9/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man using Thread\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thread’s trick is a clever mixture of human stylists, AI assistants and tools.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thread</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fashion tech startup <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/19/thread-fashion-stylist-startup-machine-learning-ai\">Thread</a> is trying to solve the problem of styling at scale. It’s a tricky beast: your style is an inherently personal thing, yet for any startup to avoid burning money, it needs to come up with a way to efficiently pick clothes for thousands of customers at the same time.</p> <p>Thread’s trick is a clever mixture of human stylists, AI assistants and tools that let both work together to deliver a semi-personalised collection of outfit ideas to every customer. It means that each human stylist is able to provide five outfits a week to somewhere in the realm of 80,000 people, with Thread’s sartorial suggestions improving the more data it has on each member. Despite its data-driven back end, though, the stylists’ fashion sense still shines through.<br tabindex=\"-1\" />Still to come: womenswear, which has been on the backburner owing to the vast increase in complexity for women’s fashion.</p> <h2><strong>Automata</strong></h2> <p>Robotics startup Automata has its background in architecture: the company’s founders spent 10 years working in Zaha Hadid’s studios. There, they learned the value of robots for simple repetitive tasks, but also the prohibitive cost of most of the machines available on the market today.</p> <p>The fruits of their labour will arrive in 2017: a low cost robotic arm, which the company hopes will give robotics its “iPhone moment”. It can be programmed by simply moving the arm, showing it the movements it needs to carry out. Those motion points are stored, and used to automate the task.</p> <p>The company has is set on automating low-skilled, repetitive manual labour. Rather than going for scale, however, it’s focusing on smaller companies that would love to automate their business but can’t afford the capital costs.</p> <h2><strong>Open Whisper Systems</strong></h2> <p>Open Whisper Systems is never going to become a unicorn, or make its founders rich, but it could be the startup that has the most effect on the coming year. The non-profit group is in charge of the development of iPhone app Signal, an encrypted messaging service that has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/26/apple-developer-signal-messaging-app-edward-snowden\">Edward Snowden’s seal of approval</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0652fc2aecf93d8fbf94ff5b30696f1656c519c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0652fc2aecf93d8fbf94ff5b30696f1656c519c/0_82_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Signal app\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Where Signal differs from most secure chat apps is its ease-of-use.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Signal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where Signal differs from most secure chat apps is its ease-of-use: the app feels very similar to everyday services like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. In fact, WhatsApp also offers encryption, and borrowed the basic code wholesale from Signal. That’s fine, because Open Whisper Systems makes everything it does available under open-source licences, which allow others to reuse the code as they see fit. It also lets anyone with the technical knowhow examine the app to make sure it does what it says it does.</p> <p>Downloads of Signal spiked in the days after Donald Trump’s election, as many realised that a far-right demagogue would soon be in charge of the world’s most advanced surveillance apparatus. Hopefully, that will prove to be an abundance of caution, but if not, the app could be a lifesaver.</p> <h2><strong>OnePlus</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bce188ee97e6f74233b39591090a836a9a59f2ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bce188ee97e6f74233b39591090a836a9a59f2ad/250_314_3750_2251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carl Pei, co-founder of OnePlus, in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carl Pei, co-founder of OnePlus, in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hardware is hard. It’s not enough simply to code something and release it to the world. You need to actually build the stuff, too.</p> <p>So it’s extra impressive that Chinese startup OnePlus has managed to rise to be one of the best smartphone manufacturers in the world in just three years and five phones. And it 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/01/future-android-pixel-google\">it hopes</a> to take third place in the global smartphone market, by units shipped, placing it square behind Samsung and Apple.</p> <p>It’s a big goal, but the smartphone maker could pull it off. It chases the premium end of the budget market – or the budget end of the premium market – by making phones that compete favourably with the flagships such as Samsung and Google, but with price tags hundreds of pounds lower.</p> <h2><strong>CCP</strong></h2> <p>Icelandic games company CCP hardly counts as a startup. Founded in 1997, the company is best known for its first and flagship game, Eve Online, a space-faring massively multiplayer game, which has been running continuously for 13 years. Eve remains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/12/how-virtual-world-edge-of-apocalypse-and-back-again\">a huge business</a>, and recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/15/eve-online-goes-free-to-play\">went free to play</a> in an effort to entice more users to jump into the galaxy of New Eden, but CCP’s big bet is in a different realm.</p> <p>Two Eve spinoffs, Valkyrie and Gunjack, have led the pack of virtual reality-based games. Gunjack, a turret shooter, is one of the more popular games on simple VR platforms like Google’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/google-daydream-view-review-comfortable-mobile-vr-headset-with-limited-compatibility\">Daydream</a>. Eve Valkyrie, meanwhile, is a full-blown multiplayer space combat sim, throwing the player into chaotic dogfights around the rusting hulks of dead spaceships.</p> <p>Both games have been well-received, leading to interest from potential buyers <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-09/eve-online-owners-said-to-weigh-game-maker-sale-after-approaches\">mooting a €900m price-tag</a>.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>In December, footage emerged of the Japanese film director Hayao Miyazaki visiting the Dwango Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in Tokyo. In the clip, which was broadcast as part of an NHK documentary, the director of <em>Spirited Away</em> is shown a video of a computerised humanoid creature that has taught itself to walk by using its head and buttocks to shimmy along the ground. After the presentation Miyazaki sits in thought, before issuing his verdict. “Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is whatsoever,” he says. “I am utterly disgusted.”</p> <p>Miyazaki’s delivery has none of the vein-throbbing fury of a Gordon Ramsay – only the life-haunting melancholy of the disappointed father. “I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself,” Miyazaki adds. A devastated researcher reels from the blow, and judging by the look on his face\\xa0may\\xa0never recover from it.</p> <p>The video game medium, which stems as much from the computer science tradition as that of the arts, has often prioritised technological advancement over humanity and empathy in its on-screen depictions. Miyazaki’s wounding judgment could be considered to be anti-experimental (indeed, the researcher eventually protests, mournfully: “This is just our experiment”) but his perspective is a useful splash of cold water on an industry that can pursue technological invention at the expense of other considerations. As the trajectory of video game technology has levelled out in the past few years, the question of how to build and populate virtual worlds is giving way to the deeper, tougher question of why. In 2017 we can expect to see a huge range of answers to that question.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84de943c9efcb1d4d3322c01063b09b48b69b70a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84de943c9efcb1d4d3322c01063b09b48b69b70a/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Horizon: Zero Dawn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Horizon: Zero Dawn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This month’s <a href=\"http://residentevil7.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Resident Evil 7</em></a>, the latest entry in the long-running Japanese horror series, will take us to sweltering Louisiana, to explore the dark history of a hick family that could have stepped from one of Truman Capote’s grislier books. Here the goal is familiar and elemental: to exploit our fears. <a href=\"http://www.nightinthewoods.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Night in the Woods</em></a> has a different aim. College dropout Mae Borowski returns home to find an impoverished American community that has lost both hope and identity. It’s a game about how the collapse of industry gives rise to mental illness and desperation. <a href=\"http://yakuza.sega.com/yakuza0/\" title=\"\"><em>Yakuza 0</em></a>, by contrast, will whisk us into the criminal underclass of Tokyo’s Kabukicho district, where yakuza factions vie for domination in clashes that can affect the city and its populace in drastic ways.</p> <p>At times of great political and environmental turmoil it follows that the themes of our fiction would return to former landscapes as a way to wrestle with futuristic questions. HBO’s <em>Westworld</em> uses the wild west as a lens to examine our responsibility to robots. In a similar vein, Sony’s <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/horizon-zero-dawn-ps4/\" title=\"\"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a> explores how, in a world where humans are returned to hunter-gathering, we might work with robots to ensure the survival of our species. For the developers of 2017’s games, the fictional, tactile realities they create appeal to a range of human instincts. The hope surely is that, in their depictions, they treasure life rather than, as Miyazaki might put it, insult it.</p>',\n",

My aim is to at least double that distance within a month.</p> <p><strong>The method</strong><br />A £400 pair of sunglasses. The <a href=\"http://uk.oakley.com/en/radar-pace/\">Oakley Radar Pace</a> glasses look like any sports eyewear – sleek and futuristic – but with the novel twist of a voice-activated coaching system. They are adorned with removable earphones, three microphones and a clutch of internal sensors for real-time updates on your run or bike ride. These are delivered, Siri-like, with the vocal prompt “OK, Radar”.</p> <p>The sunglasses are paired with an app on which you can customise a training plan based on your fitness levels. I chose the beginner setting, opting for some extra focus on improving my endurance. There are two other programmes available – speed and maintenance.</p> <p>And so my first session begins with a stilted exchange. “OK, Radar,” I say, “what’s my workout plan for today?” Radar tells me I am to do a four-minute warm-up followed by an easy 1.5-mile run. Radar doesn’t give me any specific warm-up advice, so I improvise some stretches. And then we’re off.</p> <p><strong>The verdict</strong><br />During each run I received regular updates on my pace, power, stride length and more. This abundance of data lends itself to a kind of gamification as you’re encouraged to log it all on the app and beat your previous record.</p> <p>The glasses were comfortably light and ergonomic, with minimal sliding or shaking as I thudded along the pavement. The only notable discomfort was my self-consciousness as I ran through busy parks while breathlessly exclaiming “how long left?” like a 2016 doomsayer.</p> <p>The draw here is the technology’s flexibility and responsiveness: I was caught off-guard at one point when a curt voice told me to “use shorter, quicker steps as you run”. The personalised planner is easy to use and surprisingly motivational. Whenever I missed a session, it was promptly rescheduled to a later date – no flaking out allowed. Motivation is important, I found, if you take up running in December.</p> <p>Of course, the price tag will deter casual joggers like me, and the lenses aren’t available in prescription form, which seems a shame. But for the distance-running dataphiles of this world – who are the real target audience here, after all – they’ll go down well. Of the array of nerdy features to play with, my favourite was taking phone calls wirelessly from my pocket. You can also play music through the earphones and link the glasses to other devices such as heart-rate monitors or foot pods.</p> <p>Given that most activity is tied to your mobile, the specs aren’t the most “wearable” of wearable technologies. But after being guilt-tripped by my coach for a couple of weeks, and once I’d become used to the relentless pain in my legs, my new routine became almost enjoyable. I even managed to crawl to my four-mile goal – without retching, I can report – and I might just continue into the new year. <strong>Alfie Packham</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45414613dce69da25393d9609cc2ae5dc33b57f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45414613dce69da25393d9609cc2ae5dc33b57f8/0_0_3744_5616/667.jpg\" alt=\"Miranda Sawyer with the Roli Lightpad Block.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I resolve to make a track, perhaps one that involves loops and beats’: Miranda Sawyer with the Roli Lightpad Block.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Roli Lightpad Block, £169.95</h2> <p><strong>The goal</strong><br />The goal, says my editor, is for me to create my first single. “Single!” I laugh to myself. “How out of date!” I resolve to make a track instead, perhaps one that involves loops and beats. Maybe a few squelchy acid noises. Yodelling (optional). That kind of thing. Whether I can do it is another question. Anyone who listens to music a lot understands that making music is difficult. Even if your approach is “no talent DIY” – which, of necessity, mine will be – you either need mad innocence or mad bravery to create tunes that sound good, and I haven’t been innocent or brave for many years.</p> <p><strong>The method</strong><br />A new instrument that looks like a muscle-bound drinks coaster. Meet the <a href=\"https://roli.com/products/blocks\">Roli Lightpad Block</a>, and its companions the half-sized Loop Block and Live Block. This little system is made by the same company that invented the tech-piano <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/30/the-innovators-rubber-piano-playing-different-groove\">Seaboard</a>, which won many awards. I like the way the Blocks look: they’re perfectly pocketable and nice to click together. When I first get them, in packaging very similar to Apple’s (at the moment, you can only get Roli Blocks to work with iOS), my kids are excited: they think the Rolis are new phones.</p> <p>Once they get over their mild disappointment, we get the Lightpad up and flashing, and connect to the free Noise app. And we start enjoying ourselves, making sounds by stroking and poking and sliding our fingers around the Lightpad. It has a series of square LED lights – think 1980s disco dancefloor – that you can play, and the Noise app, which visually mirrors the Lightpad, has an interesting collection of sounds, including Trap Drum, Old-School House Bass and Moraz Lead (Jean-Michel Jarre, essentially,).</p> <p>The big deal about the Lightpad is how it responds to your touch: supposedly it can recognise how as well as where you touch it, which means you can use your fingers to express a mood. This was the USP of the Seaboard, too: the idea that you can get a piece of tech-ery to respond to you playing it with feeling. It’s a nice idea. Swirl your finger quickly around the pad for one type of sound, prod it for another. Unfortunately, for an amateur like me, this doesn’t really work. Every time I get a sound I like on the Lightpad, and try to record it as a loop, I can’t repeat it exactly. It makes me feel hamfisted, rather than piano-fingered.</p> <p>The two extra blocks replicate the functions on the Noise app. You don’t really need them. And actually, as the Lightpad itself makes no sound at all, you don’t really need it either. The sound comes out of your phone. In fact, we soon discover that you can do everything the Roli Blocks offer on the Noise app. The blocks are just add-ons. Am I missing something? I don’t quite see the point of this. Especially as my iPhone screen proves to be more touch-responsive than the Lightpad.</p> <p>I persevere, but keep forgetting to charge up the Lightpad. It goes back in the drawer, and we play on the Noise app instead. But that, too, becomes limited after a while. There are a lot of sound options, but only four drum tracks, oddly. Plus, the recording is really irritating. I try to record more than one sound over each other (overdubbing, get me) and the app won’t do it. And there is no way of recording anything outside the app, such as your voice, or an actual real-life instrument.</p> <p>YouTube offers up a few professional musicians who appear to enjoy the Roli Blocks. And there are others, including RZA and Grimes, who have been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjHMFM1ykMs\">signed up to promote Roli</a>. I notice, though, that unless they’re playing live, the musicians often combine them with their existing studio set-up. Amateurs like me are left stabbing frustratedly at their phone, and, really, who needs a soundtrack for that? In my head, I’ve already got a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs4P1kKK-5k\">sarcastic tuba player</a> parping along. (He’s always there.)</p> <p><strong>The verdict</strong><br />The <a href=\"https://uk.store.roli.com/#collection-blocks\">Roli Lightpad costs £170</a>. If you buy everything you’re meant to (two Lightpads, plus Loops and Live), you’ll spend almost £500. Very expensive for a setup that has nice aspects – it fits into your pocket, it clicks together, it’s instinctive, it’s pretty – but is locked into Apple. You can only share your recorded musical efforts via the Noise app, not on to SoundCloud. As a musical device, the Blocks work much better for live messing about than they do as a recording device. And even then, if you were a musician, you’d probably have more fun if you combined them with something else, like a microphone. The Noise app is a laugh, though. Try that. <strong>Miranda Sawyer</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b1415d3dbb60509bd2888416a4f9bb012728fac9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1415d3dbb60509bd2888416a4f9bb012728fac9/0_0_5377_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tess Riley in action.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"696\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Are my feet in the right place?’ Tess Riley in action.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>TRX Home Gym, £149</h2> <p><strong>The goal</strong><br />I was never sure what core strength was. Then my fiance had a skateboarding accident, slipped a disc and spent months on painkillers before an enlightened GP balked at his repeat prescription and recommended core strength training instead. In support, I vowed to join him yet have failed to maintain my side of the bargain, which requires me to actually turn up to the gym, not just sign up to it. The TRX Home Gym promises to help you build your core “anywhere, anytime”. Could this be the answer?</p> <p><strong>The method</strong><br />The TRX training kit consists of two adjustable straps, joined for suspension at one end, with handles at the other – apparently simple stuff that engages multiple muscle groups as you leverage gravity and your body weight to row, lunge, lean, push and pull. I started sceptical – it’s just a couple of straps! – but took it all back by day three as my muscles started to ache.</p> <p>To use the TRX at home, I envisaged needing to bolt something either side of a door frame or screw a big hook into the wall. In fact, it comes with a padded attachment that anchors it either side of a closed door and a separate strap if you want to go outside. Bar the occasional chilly trip to the balcony, I used it inside. It may be an ingenious design, but I wasn’t so sure about our door frames, which I was convinced would collapse in on me like a scene from a Buster Keaton film.</p> <p>As well as videos guiding you through each exercise, the <a href=\"https://www.trxtraining.com/products/the-trx-app\">TRX app</a> provides curated workouts spanning anything from 10 to 30 minutes (add 50% extra time if you’re a beginner), all synced to the beat of whatever gems are lurking in your iTunes account – in my case, very few as it turned out.</p> <p><strong>The verdict</strong><br />The TRX website promises the home gym suspension trainer “allows you to finally find the better you!”. What does that even mean? Marketing slogans like that are my only real gripes though. I’m amazed how much stronger I feel having added less than half an hour (once I got the hang of it) of exercise to my day.</p> <p>The kit’s major upsides are how quick it is to assemble, how easy it is to transport and how simple it is to store. In fact, if I’m not taking it with me I just leave mine slung over the bedroom door now, ready for the morning – it’s harder to walk past than it was to ignore the gym.</p> <p>There were several exercises I couldn’t do, but that gives me something to work on – I wonder what happens when you’re a pro at all of them? Hopefully it doesn’t lose its appeal at that point. The hardest thing I managed was an atomic pushup, which combines alternating pushups (your feet are hooked into the lowered TRX handles) with crunching your knees towards your chest. You’re so busy steading yourself, maintaining momentum and ensuring you can get back up that you don’t realise how much work you’re doing… until you collapse. Don’t be fooled into thinking that won’t happen to you too.</p> <p>Without the app, which you can use to track your progress, I wouldn’t have had a clue what to do. Even with it, I have no doubt there’s much room for improvement. Are my feet in the right place? Do my elbows stick out? A personal trainer would be able to guide you on this; doing it on your own requires a bit of faith, alongside a few repeat watches of the instruction videos. With an increasing volume of research highlighting the importance of exercise to counteract the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/27/health-risk-one-hour-activity-offset-eight-hours-sitting-desk\">negative health impacts of sedentary lifestyles</a>, though, I don’t care if I’m not always doing it exactly right. At least it beats going to the gym. <strong>Tess Riley</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89f1a175b3dfa633f7e6a26e49aab8de18a497d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89f1a175b3dfa633f7e6a26e49aab8de18a497d1/0_0_4912_6144/799.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Graham-Harrison with the S+ Sleep Monitor.\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Overall it helped’: Emma Graham-Harrison with the S+ Sleep Monitor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>S+ Sleep Monitor, £129.95</h2> <p><strong>The goal</strong><br />So simple and so elusive – a good night’s sleep. I’ve been a bad sleeper all my life. It may even run in the family. My grandmother put together an anthology for insomniacs and used to give me tips on how to get through long, sleepless nights without panicking and making the day to come even worse.</p> <p>It hasn’t been made any better by a job as a foreign correspondent, which involves constant travel, irregular and often unfriendly hours; often, I’m up at 3am for a dawn flight, working long into the night then racing home. The stories I collect and people I meet often linger in my mind long after I have finished writing. So I’m always looking out for something to help me sleep or sleep better.</p> <p><strong>The method</strong><br />The <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/s-by-resmed-non-contact-sleep-monitor/p2629109\">S+ uses sonar to monitor your breathing and movement</a> and with that information calculates whether you are asleep and the quality of your sleep. It seemed a bit less dubious than the apps I’d seen friends try, though <a href=\"http://www.wareable.com/internet-of-things/how-much-better-can-sleep-trackers-make-us-feel\">some experts suggest </a>sleep-monitoring gadgets have trouble distinguishing the different types of sleep.</p> <p>The machine is a small cube in a brushed aluminium stand, like an iPod for insomniacs. Just plug in, load up the app, key in a few bits of data (your weight, height, age), get some basic instructions (you mustn’t put a phone or a glass of water between you and the sonar, for instance) and you are ready to go. At night, you give the app a handful of details about your day, broadly covering alcohol and caffeine intake, stress levels and exercise, and then hit sleep.</p> <p>The machine can play slightly new-age music in tune with your breathing to help you go sleep and has an alarm that claims to work out the optimum time to wake you up and so avoid grumpiness.</p> <p>In the morning, the app calculates a “sleep score”, based on how long you were actually asleep, and the amount of time it thinks you spent in each sleep stage – light, deep and REM (rapid eye movement). Then in the day it gives you tips on how to rest more effectively or deal with tiredness.</p> <p><strong>The results</strong><br />The hypnotic lullaby function (they call it “relax to sleep”) annoyed me with its tinny sound and options such as “ethereal” and “moonlight” but I have to admit I seem to crash into sleep when I put it on.</p> <p>The alarm was much nicer to wake up to than the usual iPhone setting and I did feel a bit less exhausted and groggy in the mornings when I used it.</p> <p>The sleep tracking may be unscientific but I felt it gave me an interesting insight into my rest (or lack of it). After one night when I got eight hours’ sleep and still woke up feeling exhausted, it suggested I mostly got light sleep, none of the deep or REM rest needed to make up a good night. That made sense and somehow I felt a bit less bad about being tired.</p> <p>The tips, which I had expected to be the most helpful thing about the app, were often irritating, patronising or useless. “Try to keep regular hours” is exactly the type of pointless (for me) generic advice I had expected to avoid.</p> <p>They have so much data, but their algorithms apparently ignore pretty basic variables.</p> <p>“Well done!” it told me one morning. “The amount of times you woke during the night is down!” That may have been true, but didn’t really seem a very helpful reflection on a night’s sleep that began in the early hours of the morning after a boozy wedding and didn’t last more than three hours.</p> <p>Overall, though, it helped my sleep. Knowing I’d get a readout in the morning felt a bit like having someone around to remind me to go to bed, I understood how I felt a little better and the alarm and digital lullaby worked quite well. At £130 though, those seem like quite pricey improvements. <strong>Emma Graham-Harrison</strong></p>',\n",

We were heading north but had run out of juice – both us and the car – and £40 for a double in the <a href=\"http://www.daysinn.co.uk/?iata=00091722&amp;wid=af:DI:CJ:Logo:00091722:125x125\">Days Inn</a> sounded if not romantic, then functional at least. But my wife was worried it was a motel not a hotel, and that therefore we’d “be murdered,<em> like in America</em>!” We headed to the check-in where the night manager looked like a young, blond Schwarzenegger. Next to him a trucker FaceTimed his wife, who then put their parrot on the screen for a goodnight kiss… It felt like we’d arrived on the set of <em>Twin Peaks</em>.</p> <p>By dawn, the nocturnal weirdness had lifted and under a low winter sun we cracked on up to the blissful open roads of Dumfries in the safe embrace of <a href=\"https://www.audi.co.uk/new-cars/a6/a6-allroad-quattro.html\">Audi’s new A6 Allroad</a>. As a car it is the diametric opposite of a David Lynch series. There are no unnerving moments, no unexpected twists, no surprise endings. This isn’t edge of the seat driving: it’s back of the sofa under a duvet with a mug of Ovaltine driving. It’s big, comfortable and so incredibly dependable. It could be a father figure to you, if you happen to be missing one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25d56c970762947779cdbfc78ccb6a007a2b0338\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25d56c970762947779cdbfc78ccb6a007a2b0338/0_153_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside story: the technical cockpit of the new Audi A6 Allroad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the technical cockpit of the new Audi A6 Allroad</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also hopes to be every car you’ll ever need. It’s a large estate that has the on-road smoothness of a premium saloon, but also the off-road roughness of a no-nonsense SUV. Over a long weekend I covered more than 1,000 miles in it – many of them with its perspicacious cruise control holding the fort. During one stretch I must have driven at least two hours without touching either the throttle or brake.</p> <p>One reason it drives so well is the air suspension, which raises and lowers to suit conditions. This makes the A6 far nimbler than a car of its size has any right to be. The fact that it has lost 20% of its overall weight compared to the outgoing model also helps. This means the model I drove, which featured a 201bhp 3-litre engine, was still able to reach 62mph in 7.5 seconds and do just over 50 miles to the gallon. Audi claims these are best-in-class running costs.</p> <p>The Allroad used to look quite beefy, with lumpy plastic wheel arches and huge bumpers. Now it looks a lot sleeker. To my eye that’s an improvement, but the horsey set might turn their noses up at it – the equestrian market is key for this model. Horse-mad or not, everyone will appreciate the huge boot and luxurious interior. Safety tech and driver aids are, as you would expect from Audi, well up to snuff. The Allroad is an SUV for people who don’t want to look like they’re driving an SUV. Maybe it is a surprise package after all.</p> <p><em>Email Martin at </em><a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\"><em>martin.love@observer.co.uk</em></a><em> or follow him on Twitter </em><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinLove166\">@MartinLove166</a></em></p>',\n",

But, from this year, its recorded latitude and longitude <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/03/mind-the-gap-australias-latitude-and-longitude-to-shift-2m-next-year\">will move 1.8</a> metres – a scheduled update to the local coordinate system to reflect the movement of the Earth’s tectonic plates. </p> <p>The transition to the new datum, overseen by Geoscience Australia, will be gradual over the next two years. But for the 10,000 or so Australians who use coordinates for geocaching, it has sparked much discussion.</p> <p>Geocaching began in the early 2000s as a sort of real-world treasure hunt, or high-tech orienteering, in which players hunt for registered “caches” hidden and recorded by other players.</p> <p>The cache itself is a box, often a reusable food container, though the only requirement is that it is watertight and large enough to hold a logbook. A player hides it and records its location with enough detail for it to be found by another player, who will then take something out of the box and replace it with an item of equal or greater value.</p> <p>James Finger, a forensic scientist and president of Geocaching NSW, says it combines “bushwalking and geeky technology”.</p> <p>“The old axiom is ‘Geocachers: We use multi-billion dollar satellite technology to hunt for boxes in the bush. What’s your hobby?’”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/03/mind-the-gap-australias-latitude-and-longitude-to-shift-2m-next-year\">Mind the gap: Australia\\'s latitude and longitude to shift 2m next year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since 2009, he has made about 5,800 finds, which he says puts him “at about the middle of anyone who’s taking it seriously”. He managed just over 400 this year, but backpacking through Europe “in a previous life”, he racked up a streak of more than 1,000 days.</p> <p>With between six and eight million players (and 2.8 million caches) registered around the world, the game has grown as the technology has become more accessible. In 2000, a top-of-the-line, over-the-counter GPS unit could take a player to within 20m of the hidden cache, Finger says.</p> <p>“But now your new smartphones have got comparable accuracy – if you know how to use them – with a basic bushwalkers’ unit. That’s what’s spurred the popularity. You no longer have to buy a dedicated piece of kit, you can do it on your smartphone.”</p> <p>Though the change of Australia’s latitude and longitude has “sparked some conversation amongst the community”, he says it will have little impact on geocachers, who use the global World Geodetic System – not the Australian datum.</p> <p>When<strong> </strong>GPS systems on most web-enabled smartphones, such as Apple maps or Google maps, take you to between 10-20m from the cache – “so a 1.8m shift is not really significant” anyway.</p> <p>Finding a cache also depends on the accuracy of the coordinates recorded by the person who hid it – which could be as much as 30m out from its true location, depending on factors such as nearby buildings or power lines that might have compounded the reading. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/apr/19/clockmaker-john-harrison-vindicated-250-years-absurd-claims\">Clockmaker John Harrison vindicated 250 years after ‘absurd’ claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“When the numbers on your screen say you’re about 10m away, you generally put this thing away in your pocket, and you start looking around, and you rely on your own experience and intuition,” Finger says.</p> <p>The game has changed in the best part of two decades, he says: with most players introduced to geocaching through their smartphones, its links to orienteering skills and geographic systems have become more nebulous.</p> <p>Discussion of the technology involved – even of latitude and longitude – is more interesting for “the old guard”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/25/ai-self-driving-cars-and-cyberwar-the-tech-trends-to-watch-for-in-2017\">AI, self-driving cars and cyberwar – the tech trends to watch for in 2017</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Your modern generation of geocachers may not know there is such a thing as a dedicated GPS handheld device,” he says. “It’s like trying to explain to your kids the days when mobile phones did not have the internet.”</p> <p>Most geocachers simply interact with the game at face value, as they would Pokémon Go, to which it’s often compared. (“Except it’s been around 15 years. It’s as old as the original Pokémon games are, in fact.”)<br /></p> <p>Finger predicts that games and interests incorporating GPS technology will only increase. “It’s basically a free thing for the public and game developers to utilise, and it’s one the average person is now familiar with and comfortable with.</p> <p>“Nearly everyone who owns a smartphone will use Google maps: they know what it is, they know vaguely what it can do for them. Turning that into a hobby or interest is not as massive a step as it was to those first bushwalkers who were told to trust instructions to find a hidden box.”</p> <ul> <li><em>This article was corrected on 3 January to distinguish between Geocentric Datum of Australia, which is changing, and the World Geodetic System, which is not</em></li> </ul>',\n",

Russian malware is regularly found inside computers used by US utilities.</p> <p>Vermont Democrats reacted strongly. The state’s governor, Peter Shumlin, said in a statement: “Vermonters and all Americans should be both alarmed and outraged that one of the world’s leading thugs, Vladimir Putin, has been attempting to hack our electric grid, which we rely upon to support our quality of life, economy, health, and safety.”</p> <p>Peter Welch, a US representative, said Russian hacking was “rampant… systemic, relentless, predatory” and added: “They will hack everywhere, even Vermont, in pursuit of opportunities to disrupt our country.”</p> <p>The FBI and DHS report appeared to confirm one aspect of the Russian hacking programme: the gaining of access to Democratic party emails through the use of fraudulent emails that tricked recipients into revealing passwords. Such emails were released by WikiLeaks during the election, to the perceived disadvantage of the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.</p> <h2>‘They fly under the radar’<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a199d57ae74605cdbf70e1012c57aa2e86d2ed71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a199d57ae74605cdbf70e1012c57aa2e86d2ed71/7_0_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The gates at Killenworth remained firmly closed on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The gates at Killenworth remained firmly closed on Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: THE GUARDIAN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reports from Vermont came at the end of a tense week in US-Russian relations that also placed the Obama White House and the incoming Trump administration further at odds with each other.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/dec/31/donald-trump-supreme-court-picks-democrats-opposition\">Where the supreme court battle goes from here: \\'There will be a huge fight\\'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Thursday, Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomatic personnel and the closure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/30/georgian-mansions-moscow-dachas-and-the-souring-of-us-russian-relations\">country estates in Maryland and New York used by embassy staff</a>.</p> <p>By midday on Friday, the New York compound Elmcroft in Upper Brookville, on Long Island’s Gold Coast, had been evacuated. The gates were chained shut and US state department personnel were posted outside, in a black SUV. </p> <p>The Obama administration claimed the compound had been “used by Russian personnel for intelligence-related purposes”. Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, disagreed, accusing the White House of targeting children by closing compounds he said were used by families over the Christmas and New Year vacation.</p> <p>“It’s quite scandalous that they chose to go after our kids, you know?” Churkin told reporters. “They know full well that those two facilities ... they’re vacation facilities for our kids.”</p> <p>The Elmcroft compound is five miles from another cold war-era Russian compound, Killenworth, in Glen Cove, an area known for its Gatsby-esque estates and golf courses. There, the gates were closed and the intercom went unanswered.</p> <p>The last time diplomatic hostilities broke out in Glen Cove, mayor Reginald A Spinello told the Guardian, was more than 50 years ago, when Nikita Khrushchev visited and locals threw food at his limousine.<br /></p> <p>“What happens behind those doors is anyone’s guess, but it’s our understanding it’s mostly caretakers there now,” said Spinello. “They fly under the radar. They pay their bills. The most we ever see is a diplomatic licence plate or two.”</p> <h2>‘All Americans should be alarmed’</h2> <p>With the Trump inauguration three weeks away, the latest US-Russian dispute could yet prove to be short-lived. Despite Obama’s assertion on Thursday that “all Americans should be alarmed by Russia’s actions”, Trump has repeatedly questioned claims of Russian responsibility for hacking.</p> <p>He has also lavished praise on Putin and called for better relations with Russia, putting himself at odds with the Republican congressional leadership, key members of which welcomed Obama’s sanctions and called for tougher measures to follow. </p> <p>The Arizona senator John McCain, the chair of the Senate armed forces committee, who has scheduled a hearing on Russian cyber-intrusions for next week, told Ukrainian TV on Friday he saw such activity as “an act of war”.</p> <p>On Thursday, however, Trump’s incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said claims of Russian meddling in the election were part of an effort to undercut Trump’s mandate to govern. </p> <p>“You have a lot of folks on the left who continue to undermine the legitimacy of his win,” he said in a call with reporters. Trump defeated Clinton by 304 votes to 227 in the electoral college; Clinton won the popular vote by close to 3m ballots.</p> <p>After the announcement of the US sanctions, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, recommended a proportional response. Putin, however, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/30/russia-plans-immediate-counter-measures-us-diplomats\">declined</a> to engage, signalling instead that he would wait to see how relations formed with the incoming administration.</p> <p>Trump, who said it was “time for our country to move on to bigger and better things”, did agree to meet intelligence officials next week. On Friday, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/30/donald-trump-russia-obama-sanctions\">used Twitter to say Putin was “very smart”</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/30/facebook-temporary-ban-kevin-sessums-trump-supporters\">Facebook temporarily bans author after he calls Trump fans \\'nasty fascistic lot\\'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tweet was pinned to the top of his timeline, so anyone who visited his feed would see it. It seemed as much an attempt to shock the political establishment as a way to disparage Obama.</p> <p>Trump continues to ridicule the president in public, even as he admits to having “productive” and frequent phone conversations with him. The two men spoke by phone on Wednesday and the White House informed Trump of the sanctions before they were announced the next day, the Trump transition team told reporters.</p> <p>Later on Friday, Trump turned his attention to the US media, complimenting Fox News for its coverage of Russia but criticising that of NBC and CNN – and in doing so, once again implicitly praising Putin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/814958820980039681\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Russians are playing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNN\">@CNN</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews\">@NBCNews</a> for such fools - funny to watch, they don&#39;t have a clue! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNews\">@FoxNews</a> totally gets it!</p>&mdash; Donald J.

Many local residents said they were only dimly aware of the Russians’ presence. </p> <p>“They’re not unfriendly,” said one Locust Valley contractor, who declined to give his name. “The spying is no big deal. It’s no more than what we do to them. Obama’s just getting back at them.”</p>',\n",

To set record straight: divorced Catholic.”</p> <p>Sessums added his own commentary, writing: </p> <blockquote> <p>But as those who do hold Trump to the standards of any other person have found out on Twitter and other social media outlets these Trump followers are a nasty fascistic lot. Dowd is lucky he didn’t get death threats like Kurt Eichenwald. Or maybe he did and refuses to acknowledge them. If you voted for Trump and continue to support him and you think you are better than these bigoted virulent trolls, you’re not. Your silence enables them just as it did in the racist campaign that Trump and Bannon ran. In fact, hiding behind a civilized veneer in your support of fascism I consider more dangerous. We’re past describing you as collaborators at this point. That lets you off the hook. You’re Russo-American oligarchical theocratic fascists.</p> </blockquote> <p>Soon thereafter, Sessums received a notification from Facebook that the post violated the company’s “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/\">community standards</a>” and that he was barred from posting for 24 hours. <br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It’s chilling.

I then called them Russo-American oligarchical theocratic fascists and was was flagged by someone - no doubt a fascist or fascist collaborator - and FB told me that what I posted did not meet its community standards and this would serve as a warning but they if I continued to post such things I would be permanently blocked.  To be censored and blocked rightfully naming the rise of fascism is a form of fascism itself and corporate collaboration.  On the same day that the celebrity fascist Milo Yiannopoulos gets a $250,000 advance from Simon $ Schuster to write a book they are spinning as one about free speech I am censored for my political speech and banned from posting on Facebook.

That incident also began with the company banning an individual journalist for 24 hours but soon ballooned into global outrage. The company went so far as to censor a post by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/09/facebook-deletes-norway-pms-post-napalm-girl-post-row\">prime minister of Norway</a> before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/09/facebook-reinstates-napalm-girl-photo\">backing down</a> and acknowledging the historic significance of the photograph. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/12/facebook-2016-problems-fake-news-censorship\">2016: the year Facebook became the bad guy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In October, the company responded to the controversy by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/21/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-trump-hate-speech-censorship\">announcing</a> that it would consider factors like newsworthiness and the public interest when deciding how to enforce its “community standards”. </p> <p>Policing the platform became particularly tricky during the heated US election. Facebook did not respond to questions about why Sessum’s post was mistakenly censored, but the incident highlights the company’s ham-handedness when it comes to political speech. </p> <p>The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-employees-pushed-to-remove-trump-posts-as-hate-speech-1477075392\">reported</a> in October that one instance when the company relaxed its standards around hate speech came when it chose not to censor a post by then-candidate Donald Trump, despite the fact that the post violated the company’s rules barring hate speech.</p> <p>“Mr Zuckerberg acknowledged that Mr Trump’s call for a ban [of Muslims] did qualify as hate speech, but said the implications of removing them were too drastic,” the Wall Street Journal reported.</p> <p>For Sessums, the temporary banning was particularly significant because he uses his Facebook page as a “personal blog”. </p> <p>The author has about 20,000 friends and followers, and he considers his frequent posts a “meta-memoir”. Since Trump’s election, however, Sessums’ posts have been largely political, with frequent invocations of “fascism”. </p> <p>Sessums said that he was deeply disturbed by the fact that there was no appeals process for individuals facing bans. </p> <p>“What will the cyber world be like under a Trump administration?” he asked, referencing Facebook board member Peter Thiel’s support of the president-elect. “This is chilling to me.” <br /></p>',\n",

As a smartphone, it is a decent if not spectacular entry, with dual cameras on the back and solid specifications. But it was the slot in the bottom of the smartphone that got the hype cycle churning.</p> <p>It was the first modular smartphone from a big-name brand. The G5’s chin and battery could be swapped for fresh cells, a set of speakers, a camera control and extended battery grip and a few other so-called Friends.</p> <p>The trouble was the “friends” were few and far between and those that actually arrived weren’t that great. On paper it was great, in practice it didn’t work. But the G5 wasn’t the only modular smartphone to fail last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/02/google-cancels-modular-smartphone-project-ara\">Google also pulled the plug on its Project Ara</a> modular phone while Lenovo’s Motorola released the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/10/lenovo-smartphone-terminator-vision-project-tango\">Moto Z</a> with add-ons that slightly more elegantly magnetically attached to the back. Whether anyone bought the add-ons though remains to be seen.</p> <h2>Apple MacBook Pro</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"488383c61f48c05adfe2f470226652f0fa98b801\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/488383c61f48c05adfe2f470226652f0fa98b801/0_153_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple macbook pro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 13in MacBook Pro with its new Touch Bar at the top.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After four years of waiting for anything more meaningful than a specification bump, the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/12/apple-macbook-pro-review-the-best-computer-you-shouldnt-buy\">2016 13in MacBook Pro arrived</a>. It was thinner, lighter, had a better screen and was slightly more powerful than the last one released in 2015. It had a new-fangled “Touch Bar” instead of traditional F and control keys. It even had Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint scanner, a headphones port and a starting £1,749 price tag.</p> <p>What it didn’t have were any data ports other than USB-C - no traditional USB, no ethernet, no Mini DisplayPort, no HDMI or even a MagSafe power connector. There were four USB-C ports ready to accept a plethora of dongles. Any of them could also be used for power, which is a good thing as the battery life was pretty poor.</p> <p>It’s certainly beautiful, but after four years in the making, style without substance didn’t cut it for even some die-hard Apple Mac fans.</p> <h2>Samsung Galaxy Note 7</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07223cfb66c9eeacfdc006968e37843324eed3f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07223cfb66c9eeacfdc006968e37843324eed3f1/2_0_3972_2385/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy note 7\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Galaxy Note 7 started well but ended up a hot potato.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Life for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/25/samsung-galaxy-note-7-review-the-king-of-the-phablets-returns\">Samsung Galaxy Note 7 started so promisingly</a>. It was a cutting-edge device, worked brilliantly, garnered praise from all sides and even had an iris scanner - one of the first smartphones to do so. It was predicted to sell in the millions, to propel Samsung to even higher heights and cement the South Korean brand’s lead in big-screened smartphones.</p> <p>That was until one exploded. Then another and another. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/02/samsung-recall-galaxy-note-7-reports-of-smartphones-catching-fire\">halt to sales</a> was called for safety concerns around the battery. It was pulled from shelves and the UK launch was cancelled.</p> <p>A fix was applied and the offending batteries taken out before being relaunched. The problem was that the replacement Note 7s started catching fire too. The numbers were small, but the risk was great. Eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/samsung-galaxy-note-7-exploding-battery-safety-concerns\">Samsung pulled the plug and terminated the Note 7</a>. Even still some users refused to give up the phone. Samsung was forced to hobble it before rendering it inoperative with a software update.</p> <p>There the sad tale of the Note 7 ended. Pushing boundaries in design and technology can win you plaudits and sales, but Samsung pushed too far this time.</p> <h2>PlayStation VR<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01ba933ebe022777d4ab6755cdc91b4675d93ee1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01ba933ebe022777d4ab6755cdc91b4675d93ee1/0_236_4023_2416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"psvr\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">PSVR costs about £350 and works using a PS4, not a £1,000+ PC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was heralded as the best VR for normal people. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/06/playstation-vr-review-theres-magic-but-the-mainstream-is-a-way-off\">PlayStation VR</a> promised to bring great virtual reality experiences only possible on a desktop-class system but without the need for a £1,000 PC to run it.</p> <p>The trouble was that it lacked the best-in-class controllers that really made VR in 2016. It was cheap and provided a cheap experience. And a cheap VR experience just didn’t cut it. Whether that will be enough to see it go mainstream in 2017 remains to be seen, but it certainly wasn’t the rip-roaring success many hoped it would be.</p> <h2>Apple iPhone 7</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ad6eb9ed12118f56946a33ea61827142d0fc9fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ad6eb9ed12118f56946a33ea61827142d0fc9fc/0_0_2574_1545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iphone 7\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus dropped the headphone socket, but with it, battery life and design innovation too.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The highly anticipated 2016 edition of Apple’s flagship smartphone, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/iphone-7-review-poor-battery-life\">the iPhone 7</a>, was meant to set the world alight. It was waterproof, had a much better camera and its Plus edition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/03/iphone-7-plus-review-apple-newest-smartphone-phablet\">even had two cameras on the back</a>. The physical home button was gone, instead using force touch and so was the headphone socket. But what the iPhone 7 will be remembered for will be its terrible battery life. Less is certainly not more when it comes to how long it lasts in a day, and constantly having to hunt for a charger gets old really quickly. Especially when you can’t even listen to a wired set of headphones and charge it at the same time.</p> <h2>Facebook Snapchat clones</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17f2b96df40519f067cbaaf22c49e7aef1d87da8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17f2b96df40519f067cbaaf22c49e7aef1d87da8/0_0_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"alex hern snapchat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This is what Facebook wants so badly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Hern for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Snapchat. It’s an app. You share pictures with it, draw stupid things and can even discover news on it. It’s biggest asset is a younger audience than most other services, the untapped market so many are after, including Facebook, which keeps trying to clone it after failing in its attempt to buy it.</p> <p>Facebook has tried to clone Snapchat, copying features and launching apps not once, not twice, not even three times. 2016 saw Facebook try to clone Snapchat for the seventh, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/31/facebook-tries-to-clone-snapchat\">eighth, ninth, tenth</a>, eleventh, twelfth, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-clone-snapchat-whatsapp\">thirteenth</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/09/facebook-copying-another-snapchat-feature\">fourteenth</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/16/facebook-copies-snapchat-feature-for-15th-time\">fifteenth time</a>.</p> <p>It’s getting old. Maybe Facebook should direct some of that engineering talent to working on more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/12/facebook-advertises-for-head-of-news-us-election-concerns-fake-news\">pressing matters</a>.</p> <h2>Dyson Supersonic</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"876a00dcd549309487bf895638242d696d86b7e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/876a00dcd549309487bf895638242d696d86b7e4/0_202_4256_2553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"dyson supersonic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Dyson Supersonic didn’t blow enough hot air.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Dyson Supersonic took the humble hairdryer and infused it with the vacuum-firms technology. A high speed fan in the handle for weight distribution, it’s trademark air multiplier head to blast air in your face, magnetically attaching nozzles and a round of digital buttons for controlling temperature and air speed. It looked like the hairdryer finally dragged kicking and screaming into the gadget age.</p> <p>Sadly in group tests up against hairdryers half the Supersonic’s price it was found to be a lot of hot air. Attach a nozzle and all that fancy airflow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/20/top-hairdryers-reviewed-dyson-supersonic\">dropped to a level “akin to blowing through a drinking straw”</a>.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Smart electricity meters, of which there are more than 100m installed around the world, are frequently “dangerously insecure”, a security expert has said.</p> <p>The lack of security in the smart utilities raises the prospect of a single line of malicious code cutting power to a home or even causing a catastrophic overload leading to exploding meters or house fires, according to Netanel Rubin, co-founder of the security firm Vaultra.</p> <p>“Reclaim your home,” Rubin told a conference of hackers and security experts, “or someone else will.”</p> <p>If a hacker took control of a smart meter they would be able to know “exactly when and how much electricity you’re using”, Rubin told the 33rd Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg. An attacker could also see whether a home had any expensive electronics.</p> <p>“He can do billing fraud, setting your bill to whatever he likes … The scary thing is if you think about the power they have over your electricity. He will have power over all of your smart devices connected to the electricity. This will have more severe consequences: imagine you woke up to find you’d been robbed by a burglar who didn’t have to break in.</p> <p>“But even if you don’t have smart devices, you are still at risk. An attacker who controls the meter also controls the meter’s software, allowing him to cause it to literally explode.”</p> <p>Rubin said many of the warnings were not hypothetical. In 2009 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/04/fbi-smart-meter-hacks-likely-to-spread/\">Puerto Rican smart meters were hacked</a> en masse, leading to widespread billing fraud, and in 2015 a house fire in Ontario was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.torontosun.com/2015/06/04/exploding-smart-meter-heats-up-queens-park\">traced back to a faulty smart meter</a>, although hacking was not implicated in that.</p> <p>The problems at the heart of the insecurity stem from outdated protocols, half-hearted implementations and weak design principles. While the physical security of smart meters is strong – “trust me, I tried” to hack in that way, Rubin said – the wireless protocols many of them use are problematic.</p> <p>To communicate with the utility company, most smart meters use GSM, the 2G mobile standard. That has a fairly well-known weakness whereby an attacker with a fake mobile tower can cause devices to “hand over” to the fake version from the real tower, simply by providing a strong signal. In GSM, devices have to authenticate with towers, but not the other way round, allowing the fake mast to send its own commands to the meter.</p> <p>Worse still, said Rubin, all the meters from one utility used the same hardcoded credentials. “If an attacker gains access to one meter, it gains access to them all. It is the one key to rule them all.”</p> <p>Inside the home, too, the communications are rendered insecure by outdated standards and bad implementation. Almost all smart meters use the Zigbee standard to speak to other smart devices in the home. </p> <p>Zigbee, which dates from 2003, is a popular home automation standard, used for controlling everything from lightbulbs to air conditioners. But it is so convoluted, due to the vast array of devices supported, that it is almost better to think of it as 15 different standards, each of which vendors can choose to implement as they see fit.</p> <p>“This unique situation is so difficult to implement, venders actually choose what they want to implement. And when they choose what to support, they more often than not skip security,” Rubin said. </p> <p>Other weak security decisions made by vendors include:</p> <ul> <li>Encryption keys derived from short (often just six-character) device names.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></li> <li>Pairing standards with no authentication required, allowing an attacker to simply ask the smart meter to join the network and receive keys in return.</li> <li>Hardcoded credentials, allowing administrator access with passwords as simple and guessable as the vendor’s name.</li> <li>Code simplified to work on low-power devices skipping important checks, allowing nothing more than a long communication to crash the device.<br /></li> </ul> <p>“These security problems are not going to just go away,” Rubin said. “On the contrary, we are going to see a sharp increase in hacking attempts. Yet most utilities are not even monitoring their network, let alone the smart meters. Utilities have to understand that with great power comes great responsibility.”</p> <p>Smart meters come with benefits, allowing utilities to more efficiently allocate energy production, and enabling micro-generation that can boost the uptake of renewable energy. For those reasons and more, the European Union <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/markets-and-consumers/smart-grids-and-meters\">has a goal of replacing 80% of meters with smart meters</a> by 2020. </p> <p>A spokesperson for the UK government’s department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “Robust security controls are in place across the end to end smart metering system and all devices must be independently assessed by an expert security organisation, irrespective of their country of origin.”</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Five years ago, the demise of the music industry seemed almost inevitable. Recession, rampant piracy, falling CD sales and a fear that “kids just don’t buy music any more” had giant record labels, once oozing wealth, counting the pennies.<br /></p> <p>Yet 2016 has seen a reversal of fortune – and the industry’s saviour is not what many predicted. Profits from music streaming, first championed by Spotify and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/12/amazon-music-unlimited-launch-spotify-apple-streaming-competitor-echo\">now offered by Apple and Amazon</a>, have given some labels their largest surge in revenue in more than a decade.</p> <p>At the beginning of December, one of the world’s biggest labels, Warner Music, announced revenues of $3.25bn (£2.66bn) this year – its highest in eight years. More significantly, $1bn of that was from streaming, more than double its download revenue<em> </em>and more than $100m more than its physical revenue.</p> <p>The surge in profits is being seen across all the major labels. In the first half of 2016, streaming revenue in the US grew by 57% to $1.6bn, and worldwide digital revenues overtook those from physical sales for the first time in music industry history, mainly because of streaming. This year’s most-streamed artist was Drake, with 4.2bn streams. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"842294c619ecbbecf5f67835435616c2816b3004\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/842294c619ecbbecf5f67835435616c2816b3004/0_198_2144_1286/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor Swift.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taylor Swift had a public row with Spotify over the amount it pays artists when their songs are streamed on the service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darron Cummings/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are 90 million people signed up to streaming services worldwide and the shift, and the aggressive speed at which it has taken place, is having the greatest impact on music since digital downloads were introduced. It makes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/04/taylor-swift-spotify-streaming-album-sales-snub\">boycotts by artists such as Taylor Swift</a>, who condemned Spotify for only paying between $0.006<em> </em>and $0.0084 each time someone listens to a song, seem redundant. </p> <p>Paul Smernicki, who was head of digital at Universal Records for 17 years before leaving this year to start his own venture, Restless Natives, said: “I thought the days of the music industry talking about anything in terms of millions were gone, but now we are looking at billions of streams on an almost daily basis. If you look at the the raw numbers of people who are streaming, I think you could now argue that music has never been more popular.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbf01e6b2cf43c0805a3abd0323654341a48bcb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbf01e6b2cf43c0805a3abd0323654341a48bcb5/16_0_1143_686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spotify’s Today’s Top Hits playlist\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spotify’s Today’s Top Hits playlist.

People who previously thought they weren’t that into music, or didn’t like artists enough to buy entire albums, are now discovering they are far more interested in music than they thought. I think streaming has woken people up to how music can really find its place in your life.” </p> <p>The format is so popular that less than a year after the Official Charts Company decided to count streams, as well as physical sales and downloads, it has had to change the formula. Currently, 100 streams count as one “sale” of a song, but from January, the ratio will become 150:1 to avoid certain songs, such as Drake’s One Dance, remaining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jul/15/one-dance-phenomenon-drake-no-1\">unmoved at the top of the chart</a> for weeks based almost entirely on their popularity on Spotify. </p> <p>The figures now generated by a select few artists also make Sony’s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/23/adele-set-to-sign-90m-sony-deal\">poach Adele from indie label XL</a> for a mammoth £90m this year, the biggest record deal with a British musician, seem like savvy business sense; her hit single Hello has been streamed 632m times and counting. </p> <p>But it is not just the three major labels, Universal, Warner and Sony, that are benefiting. With album purchases and single downloads, it made no difference if they were ever played, but streaming rewards consumption – the more times a song is played, the more money it makes. That shift has rewarded many independent labels, particularly those with big-hitting artists on their roster. </p> <p>Jamie Oborne, manager of Mercury-nominated band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/15/the-1975-matt-healy-no-ones-asking-you-to-inspire-revolution-interview\">the 1975</a>, said that streaming was responsible for a music industry “renaissance”, financially rewarding not just labels but also musicians. ““We’ve seen this cultural shift where people are willing to pay for music again, not just illegally download it from LimeWire, so of course my artists have benefitted from that. Sales used to be decimated by a leak, whereas now it just doesn’t matter. Digital downloads are shrinking so rapidly that I’d say they will almost certainly be gone in a couple of years”</p> <p>Jane Third, senior vice-president of Because Music, whose artists include Metronomy, Christine and the Queens, Major Lazer and Django Django, said revenue from streaming had ensured profits more than doubled on last year. Third attributed it almost entirely to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/04/christine-and-the-queens-heloise-letissier-interview\">success of Christine and the Queens</a>, the French singer who became one of this year’s most talked about musicians, and Major Lazer, whose track Lean On <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/12/spotify-most-streamed-track-all-time-major-lazer-lean-on\">was the most-streamed song of 2015</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a8d938c2b56694ad71d4d389b9dd07fe8d1eb3ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8d938c2b56694ad71d4d389b9dd07fe8d1eb3ac/220_0_2664_3328/800.jpg\" alt=\"Christine and the Queens.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The singer Christine and the Queens is one of the most talked about artists of 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Streaming is a positive thing, 100%,” Third said. “We have seen an upswing this year for the first time in more than 10 years and it’s going to continue to grow. Our company has grown exponentially, and as soon as we started having hits in the streaming world, our revenues doubled. Overall, streaming is going to save the industry.”</p> <p>Third said playlists on streaming services, particularly Spotify, were becoming as essential as radio in generating interest in a track. Indies and major labels see streaming playlists as a major part of the marketing strategy around a song, trying to “put your music into people’s consumption habits, whether it’s a playlist they listen to on the way to work, at the gym or just as part of their streaming library”. </p> <p>Streaming playlists are increasingly the way many people find their music. Creating interesting playlists is also a major focus for Spotify, which recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/dec/15/bbc-radio-1-spotify-uk-george-ergatoudis\">hired the former head of music</a> at Radio 1 George Ergatoudis to head up its playlisting team and seek out new music to champion. Streaming playlists have become so important that the major labels now have “streaming pluggers”, just as they have radio pluggers who push for songs to be played on major stations. </p> <p>Third was adamant that this shift towards play count, or consumption, would not have an impact on the sort of artist signed and championed by the indie sector. However, Darius Van Arman, the co-owner of the Secretly group, whose artists include Bon Iver, Angel Olsen and The War on Drugs, predicted there would be some impact on more experimental artists who in the past might have sold well due to credibility, but were unlikely to generate numerous repeated plays on streaming services.</p> <p>Van Arman said independent labels were definitely “keeping up with the majors” in terms of benefiting from streaming, but added: “I think it’s probably inevitable that the market is going to invest more in music that is accessible and caters to repeat listening. For labels and artists who are more experimental, the new streaming economy is going to make it harder for them to earn money on their recordings.</p> <p>“It has some impact on our A&amp;R philosophy. We do think it’s very important that experimental music and challenging music is released. There are important artists that need to be supported because they are culturally exciting and push the boundaries of what is mainstream, so we will always have one foot in that world.</p> <p>“But we have to be realistic and have another foot in the world where we are working with artists to make recordings that people want to listen to over and over again.” </p> <p>The focus of labels and artists has shifted even more towards generating a hit single, but Van Arman emphasised that streaming had not completely eliminated the album format. Albums tend to perform less well on streaming – currently it accounts for 30% of most album revenues, with the rest from downloads and physical purchases. However, Van Arman pointed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/02/bon-iver-22-a-million-review-distressed-hyper-modern-balladeering\">Bon Iver’s recent release, 22, A Million</a>, which data from Spotify showed most people were listening to the whole way through. The flipside is that labels are encouraging artists to make longer albums to monetise the format as much as possible for streaming. </p> <p>The domination of streaming has not benefited the entire industry. Geoff Travis, the founder of Rough Trade records, said: “Our sales figures seem to me shockingly low given the acclaimed quality of the releases. [But] other people seem optimistic and we are still in the game, so maybe there is a future.”</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p><em>My mum is looking to buy a new laptop after Christmas. Her budget is tight: around £200. She uses it for Microsoft Office, browsing the internet (reading the Guardian) and watching TV. I suggested a 32GB SSD drive – which would be really quick – as she will use USB sticks, SD cards and the cloud for storage. I saw one for £160, but if she bought that, she would need to buy an external DVD drive for burning music to CD etc. Would it just be easier to stay safe and get a standard laptop with a hard drive?</em> <strong>Charlie</strong><br /></p> <p>There are two kinds of laptop at the low end of the PC market. First, there are traditional laptops, where the base system has a 15.6in screen, 4GB of memory, a 500GB or 1TB hard drive, and (usually) a read/write DVD drive. These machines are not very portable and don’t have long battery life, but they do the job. Current prices range from around £250 to £500.</p> <p>The second type is much like a netbook, albeit one that doesn’t meet all the netbook’s now-obsolete specifications (such as a 1024 x 600-pixel screen). They are designed to be thinner, lighter and cheaper than traditional laptops, and they usually have much better battery life. The base system typically has a 10in or 11.6in screen, 2GB of memory, and 32GB of Flash storage. The touch-screen models often double as tablets: their screens are detachable or have 360-degree hinges that make them into 2-in-1s. Current prices range from about £150 to £300.</p> <p>The hardware specifications of new-style netbooks are very similar to Chromebooks and they sell at much the same prices. Like Chromebooks, they are designed for web-based computing, though they can do much more. They can still run traditional Windows programs, such as Microsoft Office and Apple iTunes, and they can easily use external DVD and Blu-ray drives and other peripherals.</p> <p>Traditional laptops are usually bought as desktop PC replacements. New-style netbooks and Chromebooks are better seen as companion devices that supplement either a desktop PC or laptop – though they could be seen as upgrades for people who only have smartphones or tablets. New-style netbooks are great for casual computing, and for carrying around in handbags, but they compromise on screen size, CPU power, and storage.</p> <h2>Beware of 32GB “SSDs”</h2> <p>Contrary to what you think, netbooks do not have SSDs (solid state drives) – or at least, not the kind of SSD that can replace a standard hard drive. PC manufacturers often describe them, accurately, as eMMC (Embedded Multi Media Card) drives. They are more like SD storage cards soldered to the motherboard. They are used in smartphones, tablets and low-end laptops because they are very small and very cheap, but they don’t perform anything like real SSDs. Indeed, while eMMC chips load data faster than traditional hard drives, they won’t always write data faster.</p> <p>Apart from that, I think 32GB Flash memory drives are too small for traditional laptop uses. Microsoft has reduced the size of Windows 10, partly by compressing the Windows files, but it’s going to get bigger with use. There will be numerous upgrades, growing log files, swap files, and large caches of temporary internet files. (When I removed Google Chrome, it had about 1.3GB of temp files.)</p> <p>Windows 10 is getting in-place upgrades twice a year – the <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/business/2016/12/06/windows-10-creators-update-advances-security-best-class-modern-tools/\">Creators Update</a> is coming soon – and these are installed as new operating systems. So, you need space for the current version of Windows 10, space for the new version, and space for a backup copy of the old version, which is preserved so you can roll back the upgrade if something goes wrong. August’s Anniversary Update needed 10-20GB of free space to install, and it wouldn’t install on my 32GB 2-in-1. which had 9GB free. I had to plug in an external hard drive.</p> <p>Looking three years or six upgrades ahead, I can’t see a 32GB drive coping without some massive clean-ups. Significant upgrades may have to be downloaded separately and installed from a USB thumb drive.</p> <p>Since eMMC drives can’t be upgraded, I recommend buying PC’s with 64GB instead of 32GB.</p> <h2>Stick with tradition</h2> <p>Your mother sounds like a traditional laptop user, and if she wants to install Microsoft Office and assemble tracks to burn audio CDs, she’d be better off with a traditional laptop. This is a different scenario from someone who wants a very light PC to carry around, whose data is online, and who streams everything instead of saving and owning it.</p> <p>Of course, traditional laptops are more expensive than new-style netbooks, but if you include the cost of an external DVD, there’s not much in it.</p> <p>Although no PC manufacturer now makes traditional laptops to sell for £250, you can still buy them for less than that. You can get bargains in the sales, refurbished laptops (which come with a guarantee), and second hand machines. Some companies, including HP, do their own refurbishing and sell Grade A laptops that are almost “as new”, except for coming in plain boxes. Some companies, such as <a href=\"http://www.tier1online.com/\">Tier1Online</a>, sell ex-corporate systems that may have been heavily used but can still be good value.</p> <p>You will have to shop around. Argos often has sale bargains, especially on Lenovo equipment. Currys PC World sometimes has special deals. <a href=\"http://www.laptopoutlet.co.uk/\">Laptop Outlet</a>, on the Tottenham Court Road in London, has deals and refurbished machines. It’s also worth checking online suppliers such as <a href=\"http://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk/\">Laptops Direct</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ebuyer.com/store/Computer/cat/Laptops\">eBuyer.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.morgancomputers.co.uk/c/404/Laptops-Netbooks/\">Morgan Computers</a> and so on.</p> <h2>Possible laptops</h2> <p>At the moment, mum’s best bet could be the 15.6in <a href=\"http://www.argos.co.uk/product/5996951\">Acer Aspire ES</a> with a quad core Intel Pentium N4200 processor, 4GB of memory, 1TB hard drive and read/write DVD, which Argos is selling for £199.99 (was £299.99). The exact model is not specified, and the Pentium N4200 runs at 1.1GHz to 2.5GHz, not the 2.6GHz in Argos’s blurb. However, it’s a decent processor and makes the machine good value for money.</p> <p>An alternative is the <a href=\"http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/computing/laptops/laptops/lenovo-ideapad-110-15-6-laptop-black-10146807-pdt.html\">Lenovo IdeaPad 110</a> with the same specification, except for its much slower dual core Intel Celeron N3060 processor. PC World is selling this model online for £249.99, or for £269.99 in store.</p> <p>Laptop Outlet has a refurbished 14in <a href=\"http://www.laptopoutlet.co.uk/hp-14-am012na-14-best-value-laptop-intel-celeron-n3060-4gb-ram-500gb-hdd-dvdr.html\">HP 14-AM012NA</a> with the same slow Celeron N3060 and a 500GB hard drive for £219.99. However, refurbished ThinkPads tend to be better value. For example, you could get a Lenovo <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-Thinkpad-Professional-Certified-Refurbished/dp/B01DZNQUTI/\">ThinkPad T420</a> – a business workhorse – with a 2.50GHz Intel Core i5-2520M, 320GB hard drive and Windows 10 Pro from Eflex on Amazon.co.uk for £229.99, which <a href=\"http://www.tier1online.com/728-4180a32-b/lenovo-thinkpad-t420-i5-2520m-2-50ghz-grade-b-14-1600-x-900-webcam-wireless\">undercuts Tier1online</a>. It may have a second-generation Core i5 but it’s still faster than a seventh-gen Core i3-7100U. (It runs at 35W instead of 15W, but your mother won’t care.)</p> <p>In passing, it’s hard to find real SSDs at this price level, but Laptop Outlet is selling new 11.6in <a href=\"http://www.laptopoutlet.co.uk/lenovo-thinkpad-11e-11-6-mini-laptop-intel-celeron-n2940-4gb-ram-128gb-ssd.html\">Lenovo ThinkPad 11e</a> laptops with 128GB SSDs for £249.99. This is a tough, military-spec system designed for use in schools, and <a href=\"http://shop.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/thinkpad/11e-series/11e-3rd-gen-intel/\">current models</a> start at £549.99. The LO version has no DVD and is still running Windows 8.1, but it might suit someone with a child who needs <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/accessibility/windows10upgrade\">assistive technologies</a>.</p> <p><strong>Have you got another question for Jack?

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p><strong>Warning: this article contains sexual references, sexual innuendo and unlikely sexual interpretations of ostensibly inoffensive material.</strong></p> <p>It turns out that 2016 was a pretty good year for video games. Everything else might have gone to hell, but games pretty much delivered. From the showy popcorn thrills of Uncharted 4 to the sombre gothic chills of Dishonored 2; from blockbusters to rule-breakers; from lumbering epics to short, sharp shocks, 2016 had it all.</p> <p>But was it a <em>sexy</em> year for games? That’s what we really want to know. In October, writers Kate Gray and Holly Nielsen considered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/04/the-best-and-very-worst-sex-scenes-in-video-game-history\">the whole history of sex in games</a>, rediscovering some of the highlights and lowlights (so many lowlights) of a chequered past. Now they’ve clambered back into bed to consider 2016’s most erotically charged gaming moments. And they’re not holding back.</p> <h2>Uncharted 4 (PS4)</h2> <p><em>Roguish fortune-hunter Nathan Drake returned for his fourth adventure this year, setting out to discover the lost treasure of pirate captain Henry Avery – while also saving his troubled marriage to fellow adventurer, Elena.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"531cfb942f076bb6aa949ee69e790bfb1b7fe8e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/531cfb942f076bb6aa949ee69e790bfb1b7fe8e3/71_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uncharted 4\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uncharted 4</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sony/Naughty Dog</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Kate:</strong> Is it okay if I just highlight Nathan Drake as one of my sexy games moments of 2016? Oh alright, if you need an actual single moment, there’s the bit where Nathan and Elena fall down a steep cliff together (they are always falling, it is Nathan Drake’s natural state) and then they land on top of each other and SMOOCH and, oh my goodness, my glasses are already steaming up.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> OK I get it. He’s rugged and handsome, but maybe just a bit too ideal for me. I need convincing.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> So, he’s got that floppy-haired, slightly scruffy, I-just-threw-these-clothes-on sort of look. He drives recklessly. He’s got a dark history. He’s sometimes emotionally neglectful. Oh no, this is getting personal. I’M JUST SAYING HE COULD THROW YOU OVER HIS SHOULDER IF HE WANTED TO.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Okay okay, he is a sexy man, and there is an undeniable “I’m about to get up to some dangerous hijinks, so let’s bang” tension to the whole game.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> It’s a shame that he’s actually quite bland as protagonists go, but Uncharted 4 did expand on his personality quite a bit. There’s also a very sexy fight he has with another lady. It’s all … being pinned against a bookcase, and … being … punched? That’s not so sexy. But the sexual tension is there. Oh yes.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> But Kate, why have just one sexy character creating tension when you could have a WHOLE GROUP.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> SEGUEEEEEE!</p> <h2>Overwatch (PC, PS4, Xbox One)</h2> <p><em>Blizzard’s bright, brash team-based shooter has proved one of the most enjoyable releases of the year, with its slick, co-op action and diverse range of characters. </em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"702ee3f9ed3d7582d6f5a83dd283b0d52a169538\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/702ee3f9ed3d7582d6f5a83dd283b0d52a169538/107_25_1730_1039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Overwatch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Overwatch</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blizzard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Overwatch is a sexy game. I mean, the actual gameplay itself isn’t, but just look at these characters. There is one thing that unites the cast of Overwatch, and it isn’t duty or friendship or any of that rubbish. It is asses. Sweet, sweet asses.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> I love … that … um… Torbjorn boy? He’s like a little techno viking.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> I appreciate that you’re trying. What I like is that there is an arse for everyone. Like small pert and sporty? Tracer is your gal. Want a man with a fine rump? Genji has got it going on. Widowmaker, the sexy French sniper, is often the go to butt, but I think she’s a bit of a mainstream choice. </p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> Holly, if I could just interrupt for a second ...</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Actually Symmettra has an excellent muscular …</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> Holly! What if I am not – and stick with me here because I know it seems unconscionable – a butt person? I mean, I would do terrible things with Mercy (especially Halloween Mercy, gosh dang) but I’m just not entranced by butts. Can we just talk about other appealing aspects of their anatomy?</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Oh, yeah, sorry. I just got a little carried away there. A personal favourite is <a href=\"https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/soldier-76/\">Soldier 76</a>. But before you judge me for liking the deliberately generic character – it’s all about that hair. He’s king of the silver foxes.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> First Nathan Drake, now Soldier 76. We’ve got very boring taste.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Well, if you’re not into grizzled men who haven’t smiled in 20 years, there is queen bae herself: <a href=\"https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/mei\">Mei</a>. She is a maiden of ice and she holds the key to my heart.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> Do you know what this list is lacking so far? Boys in cars.</p> <h2>Final Fantasy XV (PS4, Xbox One)</h2> <p><em>The latest title in the long-running role-playing adventure series sees lead character Noctis travelling across his kingdom to re-take a magical crystal from evil overlord Niflheim. This involves a lot of driving around with his three best friends.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14c764111a6e1f675d8afbb2f649dd483a758582\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14c764111a6e1f675d8afbb2f649dd483a758582/194_0_1359_816/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Final Fantasy XV\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Final Fantasy XV</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Square Enix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Holly:</strong> The moment we realised this game was basically ‘four pretty guys go on a road trip’, we knew it would be for us.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> I haven’t even played it and I know which boy I care about most. I feel bad that no one wants to date Gladiolus and Noctis though.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Let’s be honest the only boys worth your time are either Prompto or Ignis.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> Ignis cooks! That makes him the ultimate sexy boy.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Exactly. A lot of people like Prompto because he’s enthusiastic and always taking pictures (which I think could get a little weird). But Ignis is truly the best boy. Not only does he cook, but he’s clever, offers to drive, is caring and wears snazzy glasses.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> Good god, girl, raise your bar a little higher, maybe. OK, so, the reason these boys are in our “sexiest moments” is that … they’re so close. <em>So close</em>. They have cute little banter sessions with each other. They ride around in the car (with NO SEAT BELTS). There’s something real sexy about seeing a bunch of guys bonding and being nice to each other. </p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> I just imagine them all snuggling up in the car looking up at the stars and sharing their feelings about the world. Truly beautiful.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> So what we’re saying is, if men want to be sexy, they should be nice to each other and snuggle more.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Thank you, Final Fantasy XV, for this valuable lesson.</p> <h2><strong>No Man’s Sky (PC, PS4)</strong></h2> <p><em>The procedurally generated space exploration game proved to be one of the most controversial releases of the year – but not for the reasons Kate and Holly are about to discuss.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89a9c653a27233a56b8cc7c55e33812c6df5401c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89a9c653a27233a56b8cc7c55e33812c6df5401c/38_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No Man’s Sky: a universe filled with suggestive plants and animals\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No Man’s Sky: a universe filled with suggestive plants and animals</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Kate:</strong> Nothing’s sexier than a world where everything kinda looks like a dick. The plants, the animals, the rocks, everything. Turns out procedural generation is just a codename for “let’s make everything look like a big, purple wang.”</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Every planet you land on is like a giant non-scary HR Giger painting, but made out of plasticine. And with a lot more dildo goats.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> It’s like a Freudian nightmare – it’s a giant Rorschach test floating in space. And, wait, we’re saying it’s sexy? Yes. Yes we are. It is OK to defy the boundaries of what traditional sexiness is. We should learn to love our extraterrestrial dildo friends.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> It’s as though the Big Bang happened at an Ann Summers party and in the moment of cosmic creation, billions of dildos, butt plugs and various other plastic pleasure toys were spread out across the universe. These slowly evolved into … bigger dildos and butt plugs. But with legs. Then we eventually arrive at No Man’s Sky. In conclusion, if a whole planet of things that vaguely remind you of sexual organs isn’t sexy, then I don’t know what is.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> I think we just killed astrophysics.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://stardewvalley.net/\">Stardew Valley</a> (PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC)</h2> <p><em>Inspired by the classic Harvest Moon series, this crossover indie hit is effectively a farming simulation, where the lead character escapes the city grind to take over a dilapidated farm and socialise with the locals.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2edb4ad7a3ceab39712f68eff5a89f253049d71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2edb4ad7a3ceab39712f68eff5a89f253049d71/121_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stardew Valley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stardew Valley</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chucklefish</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Holly:</strong> You might think that Stardew Valley is a game about farming, about getting back in touch with nature and rejecting the artificial lifestyle of the big city. However, you’d be wrong. It’s actually about giving people fruit everyday until they like you.<br /></p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> That’s right, in Stardew Valley, the provision of homegrown goods is a metaphor for erotic attraction. The sexy part of Stardew Valley is filling in all the gaps that the game leaves for you. It says to you, “Oh, you like that person? You can give them an egg.” But what it really wants to say is: “While you weren’t playing, your character was giving them much more than an egg. Wink wink wink.” Seriously, no one gets married in Stardew Valley without first, you know, exchanging their produce.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> When you do get hitched, your partner says all this stuff to you like “ohh you look tense I’ll give you an extra good massage tonight” and of course you don’t see it because the magic would be ruined. In video games, a sexy night of marital bliss would just become a horrific and ungainly collision of coloured pixels – it’s just gross. But filling in the gaps is sexy. Filling those gaps right up.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> Sometimes, less is more. And if you don’t find tantalising hints at extramarital egg-giving sexy, then you should take a long and hard look at yourself.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Long <em>and</em> hard.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://lovablehatcult.dk/petite.html\">La Petite Mort</a> (android)</h2> <p><em>Created by Danish studio Lovable Hat Cult, this smartphone and tablet game is billed as a digital erotic experience about female sexual stimulation. </em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/154840989\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/154840989\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Holly:</strong> I know you’re all probably sick of games about rhythmically touching pixelated vulvas in an attempt to make them have lovely orgasms, but hear us out.<br /></p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> Holly, I am soooo bored of that whole genre. When can we get some more dang games about guns and violence? Enough of this vulva pleasure! You will only end up teaching children that having a vulva is fun. It’s just irresponsible. </p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> I went in a little sceptical, but it is surprisingly engaging, and occasionally blush-inducing. And anything that encourages people to be better at dealing with vulvas gets a gold star from me.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> Speaking of gold stars, one of the best things about this game is the app store reviews. The users don’t seem to realise what they’re saying, because it’s all things like “I’m either doing it wrong or my phone is exceptionally sensitive, no single experience lasts longer than a minute” and “this seemed too quick and easy”. Darlings, you’re doing it wrong. Sex – uh, I mean, relaxing audiovisual games – are about the experience, not how long it takes to complete. </p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Wait, are you telling me that I <em>shouldn’t</em> time every single sexual encounter I have, then use an algorithm to determine my overall score, placing myself within an imagined world ranking?</p> <p><em>[Long pause]</em></p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> I’m not saying you can’t, or that it’s wrong, I’m just saying that afterwards, you probably shouldn’t go on the app store and let everyone know that you’re bad at vulva-play because you’re impatient and grumpy.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> So we’re not saying all potential partners should play this, but I can think of worse things to do with their time.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> What <em>is</em> your highest overall score, by the way?</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Let’s move on.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://ladykillerinabind.com/\">Ladykiller in a Bind</a> (PC/Mac)</h2> <p><em>The latest visual novel from Christine Love follows a teenager who is forced to impersonate her twin brother on a cruise, forming a number of sexual relationships in the process. Love describes the game as, ‘a story of lesbian cross-dressing and BDSM-infused social manipulation’. </em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c715fba1c971c87ca8f8cff62aa07d1d762e5206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c715fba1c971c87ca8f8cff62aa07d1d762e5206/62_0_1470_882/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ladykiller In A Bind\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ladykiller In A Bind</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christine Love</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Kate:</strong> This might be our first actual full-frontal sexy sex game, you know.<br /></p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> I’m so proud of us!</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> Ladykiller in a Bind is … well … it’s … OK, here’s is its actual alternative title: My Twin Brother Made Me Crossdress As Him And Now I Have To Deal With A Geeky Stalker And A Domme Beauty Who Want Me In A Bind. So, yeah, it is a game about bondage and sex and nudity and bums and secret boobs.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> It definitely does cover the sort of boxes that a lot of people like to tick.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> It’s like an even sexier version of the movie Cruel Intentions. Machiavellian and enigmatic motives, cross-dressing, seduction and <em>tits</em>.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> If you want to get hot and heavy with something that’s more than just the standard “oral-penetrative sex-orgasm” of most NSFW material, this might be for you.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> It has ROPES. And BLUSHING.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> It has all three of the Bs: BDSM, Blushing and Breasts.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get all three Bs.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Right. A really weird Spice Girls reference feels like a good place to finish.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>In 2016, 21st-century virtual reality really arrived. From cheap mobile experiences to exuberant desktop machines, if you wanted to dive into a virtual world, there was a way. But while the headsets opened up possibilities, the new breed of touch controllers are the virtual hands drawing you in.<br /></p> <p>When you first don a VR headset you’re transported to another world, but suspending disbelief is required to keep you there. With the simple wand-like controllers or joypads, that’s pretty hard – you know you’re using a controller on the outside rather than your hands on the inside, which drags you out of the moment. Once that happens, you then start noticing the pixels of the display, the pressure of the headset on your face, the growing motion sickness and the chance to lose yourself in virtual reality disappears.</p> <p>Now Oculus, the high-powered Facebook-owned VR maker, has brought out dedicated Touch controllers. They have buttons joysticks and triggers, but they also track movement in a 3D space – rotational, positional, depth and height – as you might expect. Then they go one stage further, detecting the very presence of your individual fingers around the controller.</p> <p>When you point, so do your virtual hands. When you lift your thumb, they give you a thumbs up. You can tighten or loosen your grip, and do so individually with your index finger, all while having almost as many <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)\">degrees of freedom</a> as your flesh and blood hands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc5ce84943fafc2244bc14de24117f334c965c0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc5ce84943fafc2244bc14de24117f334c965c0a/1_0_4602_2762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"oculus touch controllers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oculus Touch controllers marked by impact with a desk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is so natural, so intuitive, that very soon you forget there are controllers, it’s just whatever you happen to have picked up in your virtual world, be that a broom, a bottle, a can, a disk or, almost inevitably, a gun.</p> <p>This is transformative. While the view around you tracking the motions of your head tells your brain that you’re no longer in Kansas, it is the almost tactile nature of doing things rather than simply witnessing them that makes you believe.</p> <p>When you’re moving through a puzzle-based shooting world in Super Hot, where every twitch of your hands, face, body or head makes a difference, when you’re picking out bullets from the air like a virtual Neo in the Matrix, or climbing up a rock face where every handhold is key, you’re transported to another realm. </p> <p>The pixels of the display, the cable attaching you to a computer and the awkward feeling of looking like a prat fades away – until you hit something in the earthly plane, which is easier than you might think.</p> <p>And that’s what VR needs to tackle next, the ability to move freely in space. For the holy grail of virtual reality – <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodeck\">Star Trek’s Holodeck</a> – you’re going to need something as good for your feet as the Oculus Touch controllers are for your hands. As attempts so far from <a href=\"http://www.virtusphere.com/\">giant balls</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uO8Z34f0xE\">rolling floors</a> show, when it comes to VR, feet are harder to cater for than hands – so sadly don’t expect to be roaming the digital plains any time soon.</p> <p></p>',\n",

This makes about as much sense as lumping all printed matter together under the heading of “paper-based technology”. We\\xa0know that’s a silly idea because we know that printed matter includes a vast range of cultural products, from novels to cereal packets. Screen-based content is just as diverse. Instead of wringing our hands over the long-established fact that children start to access this content during their first year of life, could we start to give some informed attention to how children begin to “learn about the culture they are born into” (to quote one of the signatories to the letter) and consider the possibility that some screen-based material may be enjoyed and valued by both parents and children, and may make a serious contribution to children’s social and emotional development?<br /><strong>Cary Bazalgette </strong><br /><em>Researcher on children and moving-image media, UCL Institute of Education</em></p> <p>• The harmful nature of the screen was revealed in an experiment by neuroscientist Patricia Kuhl <a href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/01/baby-brains/bhattacharjee-text\" title=\"\">quoted in the National Geographic in January 2015</a>. She taught Mandarin sounds to two groups of babies, with one group through personal interaction and with the other through video, and was astonished to find that while the first group learned extremely well, the second learned nothing whatsoever. The reason is that there was a subtle energetic exchange in the interaction between children and carer, whereas machines cannot register or transmit energy other than their own mechanical signals. This is detectable only by the new “quantum” science. <br /><strong>Grethe Hooper Hansen</strong><br /><em>Retired teacher, Bath </em></p> <p><strong><em>• Join the debate – email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>• Read more Guardian letters – </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>click here to visit gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>The worldwide system used to coordinate travel bookings between airlines, travel agents, and price comparison websites is hopelessly insecure, according to researchers.</p> <p>The lack of modern security features, both in the design of the system itself and of the many sites and services that control access to it, makes it easy for an attacker to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/23/cyber-security-breach-brian-krebs-crime\">harvest personal information</a> from bookings, steal flights by altering ticketing details, or earn millions of air miles by attaching new frequent-flyer numbers to pre-booked flights, according to German security firm SR Labs.<br /></p> <p>Known as Global Distribution Systems (GDS), the technology dates back to the 1960s, when one of the first companies in the field, Sabre, was founded. To most travellers, the technology is most obviously associated with the six-character Passenger Name Record (PNR) frequently used to enable online check-in and ticket retrieval.</p> <p>The PNR system was also the route for many of the weaknesses <a href=\"https://srlabs.de/bites/travel-hacking/\">demonstrated by Karsten Nohl and Nemanja Nikodijevic</a>, the researchers who revealed the flaws at this year’s Chaos Communication Congress hacker convention in Hamburg. While it was presented at a hacker convention, “much less hacking was actually needed to exploit” the booking system, Nohl said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/protect-passwords-two-step-verification-encryption-digital-life-privacy\">Eight things you need to do right now to protect yourself online</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the core of many of the weaknesses was the standard use of just two pieces of information to authenticate a booking: the six-character PNR, combined with the user’s last name.<br /></p> <p>“If the PNR is supposed to be a secure password, then it should be treated like one,” Nohl said. “But they don’t keep it secret: it is printed on every piece of luggage. It used to be printed on boarding passes, until it disappeared and they replaced it with a barcode.” <br /></p> <p>However, the barcode is also easy to read using a number of apps, meaning many of the 80,000 travellers who have posted pictures on the #boardingpass tag on Instagram are at risk of information theft, as Nikodijevic demonstrated.<br /></p> <p>“This is supposed to be the only way of authenticating users,” Nohl said, “and it’s printed on pieces of paper you just throw away at the end of the journey.”<br /></p> <p>A bigger problem for most users, though, is that the six-character code is easy to guess. Each GDS provider (there are several, but the biggest two are Sabre, founded in 1960, and Amadeus, founded in 1987) uses a different system for generating them, but all have multiple problems that make them weaker than a simple six-character password. <br /></p> <p>For instance, some providers iterate the first two characters sequentially, meaning all the PNRs generated in one day will have the same opening characters. Others reserve some codes for specific airlines, again narrowing the range of guesses an attacker has to make.<br /></p> <p>Many of the portals into the GDS system also have minimal security features – or at least had minimal security features until Kohl and Nikodijevic notified them. </p> <p>Some websites that have access to the system and allow you to use your PNR and last name to check the status of your flight offer no defences at all against an attacker guessing thousands of combinations a minute. The researchers were able to access multiple records. Looking for bookings under the name “Smith”, for example, and using a thousand randomly generated booking codes, five came back with active bookings.</p> <p>Attackers could use that access to cancel a flight in exchange for airline credit and then use that to book new tickets. Or they could add your frequent flyer number to hundreds of flights and chalk up the air miles.</p> <p>Even more damage could be done with the information contained in the booking. There is enough personal and flight data in them to craft convincing phishing emails purporting to report problems with the flights or bookings.<br /></p> <p>The PNR weaknesses are just scratching the surface of the problems with the GDS in general, the researchers said: there appears to be no good logging for who has accessed data and why, and access controls in general are almost non-existent, allowing anyone from any company involved in your booking to see the whole thing.<br /></p> <p>One saving grace, they said, was that the whole system might end up being rewritten anyway. As the “Smith” example shows, the namespace for booking codes is slowly filling up. Simply running out of characters for new bookings could force a rewrite of the system long before security fears do.<br /></p> <p>If not, Nohl suggested that a rise in cybercrime could do the same job. “Airlines sometimes notice this, but only when it becomes excessive,” he said. “I just hope it becomes so excessive that it can’t be ignored so that it gets fixed, because then the privacy issues get fixed as well. Privacy is never enough on its own.”<br /></p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Amazon has refused to hand over data from an Echo smart speaker to US police, who want to access it as part of an investigation into a murder in Arkansas, according to court records seen by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/amazon-echo-and-the-hot-tub-murder\">tech industry news site The Information</a>.</p> <p>Arkansas police issued a warrant to Amazon to turn over recordings and other information associated with the device owned by James Andrew Bates. Bates has been charged with the murder of a man found dead in his hot tub in November 2015. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The Seattle-based tech company twice declined to provide the police with the information they requested from the device, although it did provide Bates’s account information and purchase history, the report said court records show.</p> <p>Although the Echo is known for having “always-on” microphones to enable its voice-controlled features, the vast majority of the recordings it makes are not saved for longer than the few seconds it takes to determine if a pre-set “wake word” (usually “Alexa”) has been said. Only if that wake word has been heard does the device’s full complement of microphones come on and begin transmitting audio to Amazon.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>While that would seem to limit the use of the Echo data in the investigation, the device is also occasionally accidentally activated, through similar sounds. Those snippets of audio could potentially be useful to police investigating a crime, as could the timing information of when they were recorded. According to the report, the court records show police took the Echo and extracted some data from it.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>US prosecutors and defence attorneys have both found new uses for “smart” device data in the courtroom in recent years, especially information collected by wristwatch-style Fitbit activity trackers. In 2014, a Canadian woman sued her former employer over a debilitating injury she claimed to have sustained during her work as a personal trainer; she submitted data from her Fitbit to prove that “her activity levels are still lower than the baseline for someone of her age and profession,” according to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/11/when-fitbit-is-the-expert-witness/382936/\">reports</a>.</p> <p>Conversely, when a Florida woman claimed an intruder had assaulted her, police used information from a Fitbit she had been wearing during the alleged assault that suggested she had in fact been asleep at time. She was <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/158292/fitbit-data-just-undermined-a-womans-rape-claim/\">subsequently charged</a> with filing a false report.</p> <p>Amazon’s reluctance to part with user information fits a familiar pattern. Tech companies often see law enforcement requests for data as invasive and damaging to an industry that considers privacy a prime selling point. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/29/apple-lawyer-fbi-bruce-sewell-more-crime\">Apple went to court with the FBI</a> over the bureau’s demand that that company break its own encryption on an iPhone belonging to one of the shooters in the San Bernardino spree killing. </p> <p>But firms often retain a “back door” for their own use – to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6603?hl=en\">automatically scan emails for key terms used to target advertising</a>, for example – and that can complicate claims that law enforcement access would uniquely invade a user’s privacy. Amazon’s internal approach to user data will likely prove integral to its ability to resist the warrant. </p> <p>In the Echo case, police also extracted data from a different smart home device, a water meter. Bates’ smart water meter recorded a flow of 140 gallons between 1am and 3am, the report said. Prosecutors claim this is an unfeasibly large amount of water use, and allege it was the result of the garden hose being used to spray the patio clean of blood. Bates’s defence team disputes the accuracy of the readings.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Bates pleaded not guilty in April 2016 and is on bail awaiting trial early next year. </p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Over the course of 2016, artificial intelligence made the leap from “science fiction concept” to “almost meaningless buzzword” with alarmingspeed.</p> <p>Everything has AI now. Period-tracking app Flo “uses a neural network approach” to deliver “high period forecast accuracy”; food delivery app Just Eat launched a chatbot that “sees AI integrated into the ordering experience to ensure that customers receive the best, round the clock support and service”; restaurant guide Borsch “uses artificial intelligence to help people discover the yummiest dishes around”.<br /></p> <p>But unlike many buzzwords before it, from “big data” to “blockchain”, artificial intelligence’s transformation into venture capitalist-catnip doesn’t signify the end of anyone serious using the term themselves. In fact, 2017 looks like it could be the most important year yet for the technology: AI will butt up against not only what is possible, but also what is desirable for the first time.</p> <p>Like many futures, the AI revolution feels interminably slow to live through, and will feel like it happened in an instant in hindsight. The first pivotal year was 2011. That was when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/05/iphone-4s-siri-icloud\">Apple’s Siri hit iPhones</a>, introducing the world to the first major “virtual assistant”. It was also the year the Google Brain project was instituted: the search engine’s blue-sky research team aimed to address as many tasks as possible through neural network-based learning, the computational technique that has come to define what we mean by artificial intelligence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1264e7dc4a8e954fe28f46b1bc5590f6edeaf57b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1264e7dc4a8e954fe28f46b1bc5590f6edeaf57b/5_0_4490_2695/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DeepMind\\'s AlphaGo beating South Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DeepMind’s AlphaGo beat South Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five years on, and neural networks have already begun to enable tech which seemed impossible back then. Google and Apple have applied them to their photo apps to let users search through their pictures for images of “dogs”, “cars” or, in Google’s case, “Christmas”, based on what the algorithms see in the images. That machine vision technology is also the basis of the self-driving car efforts from Google’s sister firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/14/waymo-google-self-driving-car-division\">Waymo</a>. Oh, and an entirely different neural network is probably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/15/googles-alphago-seals-4-1-victory-over-grandmaster-lee-sedol\">the world’s best player at the ancient boardgame Go</a>.</p> <p>That victory, from Google subsidiary DeepMind, was one of the last remaining milestones for a machine to reach. Go is so complex that, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/05/the-world-of-computer-go/\">as recently as 2014</a>, many thought it would be another decade until an AI could approach the skill of a human player. That was what made it so appealing for DeepMind to tackle.</p> <p>There’s one remaining milestone that the London-based research lab is interested in chasing, according to co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, and it’s a big one: instant voice-to-voice translation. The company has slowly been assembling the pieces for a while, with Google already <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2016/11/15/google-translate-starts-using-neural-machine-translation-in-9-languages-coming-to-all-103/\">rebuilding its translation service</a> around a neural network-based approach, and DeepMind creating a whole new way of synthesising speech <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/\">it calls WaveNet</a>, but there are still a host of other problems to be overcome before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/14/babelfish-web-language-translation-lifelogging-cyberwar\">babel fish</a> becomes a reality.</p> <p>Which is not to say that 2017 won’t be a groundbreaking year for AI. The biggest effect will be the step change in the amount of data which companies such as Google and Amazon have access to. When Google released its voice-controlled, AI-powered smart home device, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/04/google-home-launch-amazon-echo-voice-recognition-uk-living-rooms\">Google Home</a>, in 2016, it already impressed some with its abilities. But, says Fernando Pereira, who leads Google’s natural language understanding projects, that’s only the start.<br /></p> <p>Now that millions of people have Google Home in their living room, the company can analyse every natural language query it starts getting from all of them, giving it far more data to crunch than it could ever get from its testers. “You can start doing machine learning on that,” <a href=\"https://backchannel.com/google-our-assistant-will-trigger-the-next-era-of-ai-3c72a4d7bc75#.rgi9pghyi\">Pereira told tech site Backchannel</a>. “You can move much faster; you can accelerate the process of getting deeper and broader in understanding. This 2016-to-2017 transition is going to move us from systems that are explicitly taught to ones that implicitly learn.”<br /></p> <p>This is the story Google wants to tell of machine learning: an acceleration, turning the coming year into an inflection point, the instant that machine learning became good enough to start trusting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62fa77286b501e99fe212b0a645a0e4b7b48704e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62fa77286b501e99fe212b0a645a0e4b7b48704e/0_115_1574_944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon’s Echo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon’s Echo is leading the way in home assistant devices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uncredited/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s certainly one possible outcome of the next year, although it’s not yet clear whether Google will be the one to deliver on it; Amazon has been keeping pace with its own Alexa assistant, for instance, while others including Facebook, Microsoft, IBM and Baidu have been trumpeting their own machine-learning successes.</p> <p>But the other possibility is that, as machine learning steps out of the shadows and companies ask for ever more data to train their algorithms, the backlash begins. Already, Google faces competition from other companies over how much of your life it wants to manage. </p> <p>That happens implicitly, in the difference between Google Home and Amazon’s Echo: the former integrates tightly with your Google account, reading emails, notes and calendar events to keep up to date with your life, while the latter takes a more hands-off approach, only linking with what it’s told and generally attempting to be responsive, rather than proactive.</p> <p>It also happens more explicitly in the way Apple has decided to weigh in against its rival. The company, freed from the need to data mine everything by its old-fashioned “sell things for money” business model, has been proudly demonstrating approaches to AI which don’t need a central repository of harvested data to learn or work. That includes its machine vision approach, which scans users’ photo libraries on device, rather than on the cloud, and its research into “differential privacy”, a technological approach to machine learning which allows the company to learn from data in aggregate while never having access to the information of specific users.</p> <p>Of course, there is a third option: that neural network-based machine learning will instead prove to be a technology like any other, useful in some areas, useless in others, and eventually doomed to be rendered obsolete in turn by a future innovation. We’re already seeing some of the downsides, in the eternal craving for more data, in the processing power required to actually learn, and in the opacity of the models that result. One day, those downsides will outweigh the up, and the world will move on. But for now, there’s still a world of possibility.</p>',\n",

The company did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. </p> <p>Facebook defended its activation of the safety check feature. </p> <p>“As with all safety check activations, Facebook relies on a trusted third party to first confirm the incident and then on the community to use the tool and share with friends and family,” a spokesperson said in a statement. <br /></p> <p>When the safety check tool was launched in <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/10/introducing-safety-check/\">October 2014</a>, it was only used for natural disasters. It was first used for a terrorist attack during the November 2015 Paris attacks. The company faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/18/facebook-activates-safety-check-nigeria-bombing\">criticism</a>, however, for its decision to activate the feature in some cases and not in others.</p> <p>In November, the company <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/11/facebooks-social-good-forum/\">announced</a> that it would no longer directly control the feature, instead relying on alerts of incidents from a “third-party source”. The company’s explanation of the changes suggest that the feature is now controlled by algorithms detecting whether “people in the area are talking about the incident”.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/12/facebook-2016-problems-fake-news-censorship\">2016: the year Facebook became the bad guy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company declined to name its third-party source for incident reports.</p> <p>Facebook has faced considerable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-fake-news-election-conspiracy-theories\">criticism</a> over its role in the dissemination of false information, especially following the US presidential election, in which news hoaxes and partisan propaganda ran rampant on the site. <br /></p> <p>On 15 December, the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/facebook-flag-fake-news-fact-check\">announced</a> that it would begin working with third-party fact checkers to flag viral fake news stories. Five fact-checking organizations are participating in a pilot program to combat fake news on the platform, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/16/facebook-fake-news-system-problems-fact-checking\">pilot is limited</a> by the staff capability of the independent organizations. </p> <p>The pilot also requires the fact-checkers to address each false story individually – a challenge given that fake news stories can rapidly multiply across numerous websites.</p> <p>The BangkokInformer.com article, for example, was subsequently copied on to <a href=\"http://www.msn.com/en-ph/news/world/thailand-explosion-rocks-central-bangkok-%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C-bbc-news/ar-BBxBHna\">msn.com</a>, creating another misleading headline featured on the safety check tool. </p> <p>A Facebook spokeswoman, Anna White, pushed back against the idea that the tool was connected to the company’s fake news problem. </p> <p>“Safety Check the product is in no way connected with any news articles – real or fake,” White told the Guardian by email. “People seeing that [the BangkokInformer.com article] at the end of the product flow may have gotten old information but that information did not trigger the activation in the first place like some outlets are reporting.”</p> <p>The false BangkokInformer.com article remains the top search result for Facebook users searching for “Thailand explosion”. It has not been flagged as a fake news story by the independent fact checkers. </p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Virtual Reality is ... well, real. The last year has seen the launch of every major VR platform, from high-quality tethered systems like HTC’s Vive and Facebook’s Oculus Rift, through to cheap-and-cheerful smartphone-based platforms like Google’s Daydream and Samsung’s Gear VR.</p> <p>The early adopters have bought in, the launch games have been launched, and now that the initial flurry of excitement has died down, the more pressing questions are left: how will the platforms evolve? What will you actually be able to do with them? And is VR just a stepping stone anyway, to the even more science-fiction future of augmented reality tech?</p> <p>At its inception, VR is unquestionably a gaming technology first and foremost. The most expensive and technologically advanced systems have an almost total focus on serving the hardcore gamer market. Even the simpler systems, which lack the pixel-pushing power necessary to satisfy modern players, still end up with a preponderance of games and game-like projects, because that’s what’s easiest to build with the tools available.</p> <p>So the number one priority for the titans of VR is to carry on winning round game developers and players to prevent the juggernaut from stalling. But if the experiences of the first wave of early adopters is anything to go by, that could prove trickier than it seems.</p> <p>Right now, the pressures of AAA games seem inimical to those of VR. Games for the hardcore niche of the market are often designed and sold around having durations in the hundreds of hours, with an individual gaming session often lasting three to four hours. In VR, as the devices work today, such heavy use becomes physically punishing: painful for the eyes, face, head and neck, as well as emphatically warned against by the manufacturers.</p> <p>So instead, many of the highest profile games at launch are designed for quick, powerful experiences. CCP’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/24/eve-valkyrie-preview-virtual-reality\">Eve Valkyrie</a> and Guerrilla’s RIGS both pack intense multiplayer battles into matches lasting at most five minutes, Rebellion’s Battlezone does the same with single-player tank battles, and even more story focused games like Gunfire’s Chronos and Insomniac’s Edge of Nowhere make it fairly easy to jump in and out of the game.</p> <p>In the absence of the life-consuming behemoths which constitute gaming for a large number of fans, VR development has instead been colonised by quirkier games, often made by smaller studios with lower budgets who can survive by selling games at a cut price to the comparatively small install base of VR devices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1f2ab41f5ffe5e3827ccdebbfef20985bd161e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1f2ab41f5ffe5e3827ccdebbfef20985bd161e1/0_92_5616_3371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google unveils its Daydream VR headset\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google unveils its Daydream VR headset</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ramin Talaie/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even those studios are betting on VR growing, though. Dean Hall, the chief executive of indie studio RocketWerkz, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/5h51dd/the_hard_truth_about_virtual_reality_development/?st=iww000i8&amp;sh=dd52baaf\">wrote that his company’s game</a>, Out of Ammo, “has exceeded our sales predictions and achieved our internal objectives”. </p> <p>“However, it has been very unprofitable. It is extremely unlikely that it will ever be profitable. We are comfortable with this, and approached it as such. We expected to lose money and we had the funding internally to handle this. Consider then that Out of Ammo has sold unusually well compared to many other VR games.”</p> <p>Currently, platform owners are subsidising much of the development for VR, in exchange for making those games platform exclusives. But those owners will also need to make money at some point; they’re just capable of playing a longer game than an independent developer.</p> <p>In that long term, VR needs to be more than an accessory for better games. Back in 2014, Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/29/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-oculus-vr-sales\">targeted an install base of 50m to 100m Oculus headsets</a> in the device’s first decade. At the top end, that’s equal to the total sales of the Playstation 4 and Xbox One combined, for a device which currently needs a PC to run it that costs more than a PS4 and Xbox One combined. </p> <p>Of course, Zuckerberg isn’t interested in owning a gaming company, even a successful one. He bought Oculus with the stated intention of offering far more than just better video games. “Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face – just by putting on goggles in your home,” he wrote in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101319050523971\">the post announcing the company’s acquisition</a>. <br /></p> <p>Perhaps tellingly, in the years since, Zuckerberg has spent far more time focusing on Oculus’ smaller, more accessible product, the Gear VR, than on the weighty, tethered Rift headset. At the Mobile World Congress conference in February, <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/22/11087890/mark-zuckerberg-mwc-picture-future-samsung\">attendees were handed one to try</a>, causing them to miss the smiling executive strolling past them on his way to the stage.</p> <p>Last week, Facebook announced <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/blog/building-the-future-of-vr?utm_source=Triggermail&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Post%20Blast%20%28bii-apps-and-platforms%29:%20Facebook%27s%20Oculus%20splits%20into%20PC%2C%20mobile%20%E2%80%94%20Nintendo%27s%20Super%20Mario%20mobile%20game%20could%20rake%20in%20millions%20%20%E2%80%94%20LINE%20adds%20group%20video%20support&amp;utm_term=BII%20List%20Mobile%20ALL\">it would split Oculus into two divisions</a>, one focusing on PC-based VR, and the other on mobile. It’s clear on which Zuckerberg is staking the future of computing, and it’s not the tethered division which current Oculus CEO Brendan Irbe will be heading up.</p> <p>If VR is going to become the next major computing platform, pushing mobile phones aside the way they left desktop PCs lagging in their wake, 2017 will be the crunch point: platforms like Google’s Daydream, and whatever Oculus offers as the follow-up to Gear VR, need to arrive with the same pop that tethered VR entered in the past year. More, they need a compelling reason for those who don’t care about gaming to buy in, be that experiences like 360-degree video, or social platforms like those Facebook wants to build.</p> <p>If they don’t, they could find themselves obsolete before they even hit the mainstream, thanks to the new technologies peeking over the horizon. If VR doesn’t charm, could AR succeed where it failed?</p> <p>AR devices, like Microsoft’s Hololens and <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/why-augmented-reality-is-so-hard\">vaporware start-up Magic Leap</a>’s prototypes, allows virtual images to be imprinted over the real world. It’s not cheap – the developer preview of the Hololens retails for almost £3,000 – but it fixes a number of issues which hold VR back when it comes to everyday practicality. Hololens users can still interact with the real world, with their colleagues and companions, rather than locking themselves away in a virtual space. That interaction makes it much more appealing to imagine using Hololens as a general-purpose computing system, fitting in alongside your current life.</p> <p>Or maybe neither will actually take off in the foreseeable future. For the first time in well over a decade, technology companies worldwide are looking at the end of one hyperbolic growth curve – that of smartphones – with nothing obvious to pick up where it died off. They may have a lot of interest in convincing their shareholders that something is the next big thing, but that doesn’t mean we have to believe them. After all, we live in reality.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/22/video-games-virtual-reality-e3-2016\"><strong>If the future of video games is VR, it needs to stop making us feel sick</strong></a><br /></li> </ul>',\n",

But beyond the investment headlines, we also need to see evidence of a joined-up approach to finding a long-term solution to providing universal superfast broadband, which, as well as improving 4G and 5G, will mean converging fibre broadband and local wireless infrastructure, rather than still relying in many areas on the old copper systems we have today.

It seems little has changed | Helen Powell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The analysis found that 71% of white engineering graduates were in full-time jobs within six months of leaving university, compared with just 52% of Asian students and 46% of black students.<br /></p> <p>When gender, age, class of degree and type of institution were taken into account, black and Asian graduates were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as their white counterparts.</p> <p>The figures highlight an apparent paradox in which government and industry leaders have consistently pointed to a national shortage of engineers, while a high proportion of black and ethnic minority graduates are failing to find jobs. Indeed, the science minister, Jo Johnson, noted “the chronic shortages of engineers that have long held our economy back” in <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dyson-university-is-a-wake-up-call-for-higher-education-gjgnz5gls\">a comment article</a> last month.</p> <p>The shortage of engineers is often cited as an incentive to attract more women into the profession – just 12-15% of engineering undergraduates are female.</p> <p>“That’s true, but what about the missed opportunity with all these graduates from ethnic minority backgrounds?” said Fatimilehin. “It feels like a low hanging fruit.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/03/engineering-apprenticeships-courses-women-engineers-education-degrees\">Gender has dominated the diversity agenda in engineering</a> for the past decade, but the report found that it only has a minor influence on immediate employment prospects for graduates. Women were slightly less likely to enter engineering occupations after university, but more likely to pursue further study.<br /></p> <p>The focus on “getting girls into engineering” has led to the lack of progress on racial diversity being overlooked, according to Fatimilehin.</p> <p>“People come back to gender because it feels safer,” she said, adding that male engineers tended to get behind the idea that women face additional barriers because most would have a wife, daughter or female friend. “They’re less likely to have a friend who is black,” she said.</p> <p>The RAEng report puts forward several possible explanations for the findings, which were based annual destination surveys of around 250,000 students by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). Engineering firms often recruit from Russell Group universities, which on average have lower proportions of ethnic minority students. However, even when institution type is taken into account there is a gulf between the employment prospects of white students and black and Asian ones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2015/jun/18/engineers-unless-we-wave-our-arms-a-bit-well-never-inspire-the-next-generation\">Engineers, unless we wave our arms a bit we\\'ll never inspire the next generation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“This suggests statistically that ethnicity itself is correlated with an unemployment outcome, and is a stronger effect than any of the other factors studied,” the report concluded.</p> <p>According to Fatimilehin, unconscious bias, preconceptions about who will “fit in” with company culture and people “recruiting in their own image” also play a role.</p> <p>“The chief execs say ‘there’s nobody out there’,” she said. “There are people out there. As a society we need to get better at looking for people, rather than just accepting that a certain type of black person doesn’t exist.”</p> <p>Anita Bernie, director of spacecraft platforms at Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL), said she was “amazed” by the gulf in career prospects between white and ethnic minority students. Bernie, who is black, said that SSTL has a diverse mix of ethnicities and that most of her current team are female.</p> <p>“When I go to other companies, the mix in terms of gender and ethnicity is very different,” she said.</p> <p>Bernie agreed that employer recruitment bias is likely to be a problem. “It’s partly human nature that you tend to want to recruit people like you,” she said. “It’s really easy to see a young white lad come in and think ‘I used to be like that’. I do think that exists in other companies.”</p> <p>Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission said: “It is shocking that black and minority ethnic people with degrees are still not getting the same job opportunities as others. This suggests we have a long way to go to create the equal society the prime minister talked about on the steps of Downing Street.”</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-work/news/widespread-inequality-risks-increasing-race-tensions-warns-ehrc\">EHRC report</a> published earlier this year found that the life prospects for young black and minority ethnic people have got much worse over the past five years and are at their most challenging for generations. On average, black, Asian and ethnic minority workers with degrees are two-and-a-half times more likely to be unemployed than white workers with degrees, the report found.</p> <p>Belinda Phipps, CEO of the Science Council, welcomed the RAEng review, saying it was important to highlight inequalities in the profession. “From the moment a baby is born its life is shaped by the enforcement of stereotypes: girl children are taught they must be clean and quiet; those of certain ethnic origin are expected not to succeed,” she said.</p>',\n",

The ten-year-old has been grappling with it for about a minute when she smiles: “13!”.</p> <p>Her tutor responds by posting a large smiley cat picture on her screen – the virtual equivalent of a pat on the back. He is sitting on the other side of the world in an online tutoring centre in India.</p> <p>Ambar, who attends Pakeman primary school in north London, is one of nearly 4,000 primary school children in Britain signed up for weekly one-to-one maths sessions with tutors based in India and Sri Lanka. The lessons, provided by a company called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.thirdspacelearning.com/\">Third Space Learning</a>, are targeted at pupils struggling with maths – particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/07/can-technology-replace-teachers-google\">Can technology replace teachers? You asked Google – here’s the answer | Harpreet Purewal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From next year, the platform will become one of the first examples of artificial intelligence (AI) software being used to monitor, and ideally improve, teaching.</p> <p>Together with scientists at University College London (UCL), the company has analysed around 100,000 hours of audio and written data from its tutorials, with the goal of identifying what makes a good teacher and a successful lesson.</p> <p>Tom Hooper, the company’s CEO, said: “We’re looking to optimise lessons based on the knowledge we gain. We’ve recorded every lesson that we’ve ever done. By using the data, we’ve been trying to introduce AI to augment the teaching”.</p> <p>Initially, the company’s 300 tutors will receive real-time, automated interventions from the teaching software when it detects that a lesson may be veering off-course.</p> <p>Pupils on the programme have a 45-minute session with the same tutor each week. They communicate through a headset and a shared “whiteboard” (they can’t see each other). The lessons at Pakeman school are tailored to the individual, including visual rewards linked to the child’s interests. Premier League strikers for nearby Arsenal, cute animals and pink, iced doughnuts flash up on the screens of Ambar’s classmates.</p> <p>In addition to the raw audio data, each lesson has various success metrics attached: how many problems completed, how useful the pupil found the session, how the tutor rated it. Using machine learning algorithms to sift through the dataset, the UCL team has started to look for patterns.</p> <p>An early analysis found, perhaps unsurprisingly, that when tutors speak too quickly, the pupil is more likely to lose interest. Leaving sufficient time for the child to respond or pose their own questions was also found to be a factor in the lesson’s success, according to Hooper. These observations are likely to form the basis of the initial prompts that the tutors will receive, probably in the form of messages flashing up on their screen.</p> <p>“We’re going to be drip-feeding it in in relatively simple ways to start with,” said Hooper.</p> <p>As the technology evolves, the interventions could become more sophisticated and the software might play a more active role in teaching, raising questions about the extent to which intelligent software could replace human teachers.</p> <p>Rose Luckin, a professor of learner centred design at University College London, who is collaborating with Third Space Learning on the project, said: “What we are very interested in is the right blend of human and artificial intelligence in the classroom – identifying that sweet spot.”</p> <p>According to Luckin, AI provides a unique opportunity to assess which teaching strategies are working and to individualise teaching. </p> <p>“It would be able to say, for this child at the moment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/teacher-blog/2013/apr/01/phonics-teaching-resources-schools\">Jolly Phonics</a> is working well,” she said. “You would be able to look back over their reading process and see which interventions worked. The potential for the use of AI to make education tractable and visible is huge.”</p> <p>However, she predicts that the insights gleaned from AI will often be applied by human teachers. “What I’m really concerned about is that people don’t run away with the idea that kids have to be plugged into the computer,” she said. “It’s about so much more than that.”</p> <p>Hooper agreed that the aim is not to replace teachers with robots. “There’s a slightly dubious conversation about how AI will make humans irrelevant, but it’s not at all about replacing humans,” he said. “Our whole belief is that for children disengaged with the subject, who are lacking in confidence, people is what matter. An algorithm can’t provide that.”</p> <p>He said he does not expect his tutors, most of whom are science graduates, will be concerned about the automated feedback. “We’ll need to be considerate about it,” he said, adding that it would not be “a bossy algorithm barking orders at people”.</p> <p>Shazli Mahroof, 27, a tutor team leader based in Colombo, Sri Lanka, said he was not worried about being replaced by a teaching robot in the near future. “It’s not the computer who is going to teach,” he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/may/08/online-teachers-learning-higher-education\">Online students and teachers are no different from the rest of academia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tutors already have one lesson each week assessed by supervisors, and it is fairly obvious, subjectively, when things are progressing well, according to Hooper.</p> <p>“We’re asking ‘how do we promote those teaching events at scale?’” he said.</p> <p>Companies entering this sphere also need to convince parents and teachers that the data being collected is both secure and will ultimately benefit pupils.

An infant class in the school hall is rehearsing a performance and the school has an end-of-term feeling in the air, but the atmosphere in the online learning session is one of hushed focus.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>After finishing the lesson, Ambar said that maths used to make her anxious, but since starting the weekly tutorials in Year 5, she has started enjoying it. “When they give you horrible sums, they help you,” she said. “I was scared to do it, but it was actually fun.”</p>',\n",

Sky’s Q <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/sky-q-review-broadcast-satellite-pay-tv\">dragged broadcast TV kicking and screaming into the 21st century</a> with a modern interface, fast box and service that put time and place shifting at the heart of it.</p> <p>It records, it downloads, it supports 4K and can spit video around your house via Q Mini boxes or the Q app on smartphones and tablets using your home network.

But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/16/wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-bragi-jabra-elite-earin-motorola\">2016 was the year that truly wireless earbuds</a> – no wires connecting them at all – became a thing.</p> <p>Many tried and failed to produce wireless earbuds, but they weren’t capable of maintaining a stable connection between your ears because pushing the low-energy Bluetooth signal through your head when there’s any interference in the air is difficult.</p> <p>Apple had to delay its AirPods, but at the end of 2016 Jabra’s Elite Sport and Bragi’s the Headphone proved it could be done.

From HTC’s Vive to Google’s Daydream, there was a headset to suit almost any budget. But it was the release of Oculus’ Touch controllers that really made VR an experience worth having.</p> <p>The revolutionary hand controllers did more than just track the motions of your hands and give you buttons to squeeze. They actually tracked the position of your fingers on the controllers – you can point, grab, squeeze, give the thumbs up and pull a trigger with ease. The natural import of your hands into the virtual world is simply brilliant, even if you still need a £1,000 PC to run it.</p> <h2>Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46aad096066cbb07aa971b1be0b8cfb90c46a772\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46aad096066cbb07aa971b1be0b8cfb90c46a772/0_0_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy s7 edge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Galaxy S7 Edge has curved 5.5in screen squeezed into a body not much bigger than a traditional 5in smartphone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Price:</strong> £520</p> <p>We’d had curved screened smartphones before, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/11/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-review-android-smartphone-phablet-marshmallow\">Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge showed just why they were good</a>.

Want the lights on? Just ask. Maybe set the heating to a few degrees warmer? Yep.

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>In some ways, tech in 2017 will be a steady progression from what came before it. Time marches on, and so too does the advance of technology. In other ways, though, it will be just as upended as the rest of the world by the unprecedented disruption that 2016 has left in its wake.</p> <p>Here are the trends to watch out for in the coming year:</p> <h2>More AI, less data</h2> <p>The artificial intelligence revolution is well and truly upon us, but so far, the biggest players are venerable Silicon Valley titans such as Google, Amazon and Apple. That’s partially because they have the money to hire teams full of PhDs at seven-figure salaries, but it’s also because they have the data.</p> <p>That could change. One of the key areas of research for 2017 is data efficiency: the problem of trying to teach machine-learning systems how to do more, with less. Think about how many times your average three-year-old needs to see a particular animal before they can correctly identify it, compared with the thousands of images a neural network needs to ingest to perform the same basic task.</p> <p>Solving the problem of data efficiency could dramatically open up the industry, letting new startups compete on a level playing field with those who have access to petabytes of customer data. And it could also change what an AI can do for you, letting an assistant become far more sensitive to your personal quirks and foibles, or a photo-tagging service recognise specific locations, objects, or situations.</p> <h2>Mostly-self-driving cars</h2> <p>Self-driving cars exist on a scale. At one end, you’ll find technologies that are barely more than fancy cruise control: lane-assist features ensure your car doesn’t drift out of lane, while adaptive cruise control will maintain a steady distance from the car in front. At the other end is full automation: a car that can drive from a parking space outside your house to a parking space outside your office with no-one touching the steering wheel, or even sitting in the car at all.</p> <p>The story of 2017 will be car companies racing almost all the way to that final hurdle, but just stopping short. Not only the tech companies, either (although expect Tesla’s own models to lead the way, closely followed by Google’s sister company Waymo’s alliance with Fiat Chrysler). Conventional manufacturers the likes of Nissan and BMW are jumping into the field with both feet, and their systems will only get smarter. And who knows what Apple’s plans are?</p> <p>But don’t expect anyone to make the difficult jump to full self-driving capability any time soon. Not only are the regulatory and liability hurdles immense, but the tech just isn’t there for the vast majority of journeys. There’s a reason Google tested its first ever fully automatic trip in Texas, land of wide lanes, huge highways, and car-centric development. Drop that car in the middle of a busy London backstreet and it won’t do so well.</p> <p>The big question is whether all this automation will actually make things safer. On the one hand, cars don’t get distracted, drunk, or tired, all of which lie at the root of most fatalities on the road. On the other hand, if people are told to supervise a car which mostly drives itself, they tend not to be prepared to take over if it actually does need assistance – a problem that lay behind the first self-driving fatality in May.</p> <h2>Cyberwar</h2> <p>Let’s not mince words: cyberwar has already begun. If it didn’t start in 2008, when (probably) the Israeli and US intelligence services used the Stuxnet virus to destroy Iranian nuclear centrifuges, and it didn’t start in 2015, when the US Office of Personnel Management was hacked by (probably) China, stealing the personal details of millions of government employees, then it certainly started in 2016, when (probably) Russia hacked in to the Democratic National Congress, exflitrating emails which were released with the intention of altering the outcome of an election.</p> <p>Those “probably”s expose part of the appeal of cyberwar for nation states: attribution is hard, and rock-solid attribution to not just a nation but a chain of command is almost impossible. The incoming US administration is already making aggressive overtures about its desire to get on the attack, which will inevitably also make it a bigger target, according to security expert Hitesh Sheth, head of cybersecurity firm Vectra. </p> <p>“US businesses and the US government should expect an increase in the number and severity of cyber-attacks, led by select nation states and organised political and criminal entities,” he says.</p> <h2>The ghost of Christmas data breaches past</h2> <p>It feels like data breaches are everywhere. But that’s often not the case; while companies are indeed compromised on a regular basis, modern security practices usually ensure that not much is stolen, and what does get taken isn’t easy to exploit.</p> <p>Instead, the more dangerous trend is old breaches surfacing, like an unexploded second-world-war bomb, to wreak havoc on the present. That’s what happened to Yahoo, twice in one year, when data breaches from 2013 and 2014 resurfaced. The breaches were huge, containing a billion and half a billion accounts respectively, and the information within them was barely secured. Passwords were obfuscated with a standard which has been known to be insecure since 2005, while other info, including security questions, was in plain text.</p> <p>Because data breaches can happen undetected, fixing your cybersecurity in 2016 isn’t just locking the stable door after the horse has bolted; it’s locking the stable door without even realising the horse made its escape years ago.</p> <p>The information in historical breaches has often been traded on the darknet for some time before their existence surfaces, meaning the damage comes in two waves: first, slowly, and then all at once.</p> <h2>Meet eSports, the new sports</h2> <p>Competitive video gaming is a huge business. In 2016, investment bank GP Bullhound estimated it hit a global audience of over 250 million people, and amassed a total annual revenue of $493m – and in 2017, that’s predicted to more than double, making eSports a billion-dollar sector.</p> <p>The scale of the eSports industry is down to a number of factors, from increased broadband penetration making online multiplayer gaming accessible to most of the world to online streaming allowing budding eSports stars to skip conventional media and go straight to their fans. </p> <p>But it’s now big enough to warp the very industry that spawned it, with major games publishers courting the eSports community from the inception of their latest releases. Blizzard, a Californian company best-known for its online game World of Warcraft, has been one of the leaders in the field, with games including Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch and Hearthstone all having online viewerships in the millions, but the standout success is Riot Games, whose sole title League of Legends had more viewers in its 2015 world championship than the final game of 2016’s NBA Finals.</p> <p>GP Bullhound says the next big wave is going to come from mobile, with games like Clash Royale and Vainglory representing the fastest growing segment of the global $37bn games market. Of course, this might all pass you by: over half of eSports fans are millennials, by far the youngest skew of any group of sports supporters.</p> <h2>The great privacy divide</h2> <p>The world’s most advanced surveillance operation will shortly be under the direct control of a far-right demagogue who routinely attacks critics on social media and uses the office of US president-elect to bolster his commercial interests. That has left some people worried.</p> <p>As a result, many are re-examining their online privacy, switching to encrypted messaging services, locking down social media accounts, and limiting the amount of information they put online. Signal, an encrypted messaging app recommended by Edward Snowden, saw a huge spike in downloads following Donald Trump’s election, while hundreds of tech workers <a href=\"http://neveragain.tech/\">signed a pledge</a> to never implement the president-elect’s proposed registry of Muslims.</p> <p>At the same time, though, trends in AI and online monetisation have pushed other tech firms to slowly chip away at the amount of privacy their users have, data-mining ever more aspects of their online lives in an effort to offer better services and create smarter software. Google, for instance, will now train a machine-learning system on your photos, read your emails to find useful information to add to your calendar, and save everything you say to it to improve its voice recognition.</p> <p>Over 2017, this divide will only increase: companies like Apple and Signal on the one side, and Facebook and Google on the other. In the end, the market will decide. Are people willing to give up the latest and greatest fruits of machine-learning to limit their exposure to surveillance, or do they not really care about online privacy and want everything as soon as it’s technologically possible? </p> <h2>Chinese tech goes west</h2> <p>The likes of Foxconn may build the world’s most premium tech, but in the west, Chinese brands are still largely associated with cheap electronics: no-name flat panels and <a href=\"http://thehackernews.com/2016/11/hacking-android-smartphone.html\">cheap smartphones that spy on you</a>. As for software, the entire country can feel as if it’s seen through analogues to Silicon Valley, from “China’s Google” (Baidu) to “China’s Twitter” (Sina Weibo).</p> <p>But an increasing number of Chinese companies have their eyes set on the richer markets of Europe and America, without giving up on the customer base in their own country. Shenzhen-based OnePlus, for instance, has slowly carved out a niche for itself with its high-quality, low-price range of smartphones, which aim to match the flagships from Apple and Samsung while offering price-sensitive users savings of hundreds of pounds. Huawei, already a fairly well-known brand in the west, is pushing its Honor brand as a way to drop the budget image for a new demographic.</p> <p>And software firms are getting in the game too. Tencent, makers of WeChat (that’s “China’s WhatsApp”, for those playing along at home), is pushing hard into the west, taking on Facebook at its own game. The service is currently most popular with Chinese expats, but it’s clear that Facebook is watching closely: a number of features in Messenger are ripped wholesale from the hugely influential service.</p>',\n",

Now Facebook is attempting to teach its users how to play nice.</p> <p>Its newly updated <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/safety\">safety centre, including its “bullying prevention hub”</a> are central to its strategy to improve the quality of discourse on the platform – for the sake of its future as much as for its users’ experience. </p> <p>“If people don’t have a positive experience, they’re not going to keep using Facebook, so safety is actually integral to everything we do,” says Mia Garlick, director of policy and communications for the platform in the Australia-Pacific region.</p> <p>Asked if she has statistics that show whether disillusioned users are closing their accounts, Garlick says no – somewhat surprisingly, given the volume of data that Facebook collects. It certainly records growth: in its third quarter report for 2016, Facebook had 1.79 billion monthly active users, an increase of 16% year-on-year. There are now 15 million Australians active on Facebook, 62.5% of the total population.</p> <p>At that size, it’s an unwieldy community, encompassing a wide range of investment: for example, it has about 600,000 fewer daily active users than those who log in monthly. Facebook’s hope is that its new resources will equip them with the knowledge and resources they need to be a somewhat self-policing community.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/09/facebook-revenge-pornography-case-could-open-floodgates\">Facebook revenge pornography trial \\'could open floodgates\\'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Developed in tandem with the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence in 2013, the bullying prevention Hub is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/safety/\">a website</a>, linked to but separate from Facebook’s homepage. Newly updated to put greater focus on video, it delivers support for teenagers, parents and educators on how to prevent and respond to online abuse.</p> <p>Much of the advice seems obvious. The hub advises teenagers to remember “that bullying is never your fault, and it can happen to anyone”. If your child is being bullied, “try to stay calm”. And if you are unsure, you can download a document that explains “What is bullying?”</p> <p>The separate safety centre is geared towards explaining Facebook-specific tools, resources and policies, as well as advice as to how to apply them: “Before you share, ask yourself: could somebody use this to hurt me?”</p> <p>Garlick says there is a generation gap that Facebook must help its users bridge. Parents, in particular, need to be confident about using the platform to educate their children about the risks.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>“Young people are very sophisticated about how they use technology, but sometimes they haven’t actually gone through all of the thought processes that they should.”</p> <p>But the usefulness of the resources depend on people knowing they exist and how to find them, which Garlick says is a “challenge”. She says instructional videos are posted to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FacebookAU/?brand_redir=20531316728\">Facebook’s regional branded pages</a>, and it has “reached out” to educational partners in the hope that they will share it within their networks.</p> <p>If Facebook wanted all 1.8 billion monthly users to be aware of the hub, it could simply push it out to them top of their news feeds – where the network on occasion posts messages as anodyne as the hope that users <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jrhennessy/status/804039943949406208\">have a “fun and happy” summer</a>. </p> <p>And it does – occasionally.</p> <p>“The thing to keep in mind is that the vast majority of conversations and interactions on our platform are really, really positive,” Garlick says. She says Facebook’s tools and resources are about empowering users to look after themselves, and to encourage them to exercise control over their interactions on the platform.</p> <p>One relatively recent addition is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/799880743466869\">the security checkup</a>, which explains who can see your posts and how to restrict their access, step by step. It’s straightforward for irregular Facebook users to grasp but in-depth enough to bring value to the confident ones.</p> <p>Garlick says 4,000 privacy checkups are carried out on the site each day. Even she benefited from the tool, using it to do “a bit of spring cleaning” of the apps she had used since 2007.</p> <p>Self-sufficiency is a cornerstone of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/181495968648557\">Facebook’s reporting process</a>, which asks that users flag objectionable material for review against its community standards – still the best tool the platform has for ruling what is and is not acceptable.</p> <p>Automation is used to prevent malware and crack down on fake accounts, and some software is used for child exploitation images and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/05/facebook-twitter-google-microsoft-terrorist-extremist-content\">soon, extremist content</a>.

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>What you choose to call your wireless network can say a lot about you. If you’re the attendee of an “alt-right” event at Texas A&amp;M University who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jeff_Journalist/status/806303337058603008\">decided to promote genocide</a> in the form of a network ID, it can say you are violently racist. While it is perhaps not surprising to see the USA’s new far-right white supremacist movement engaging with the language of Nazism, there seems something particularly insidious in using such hateful language in something as benign as a Wi-Fi connection.</p> <p>What turns a simple technical feature into a personalised billboard? <a href=\"http://staffprofiles.bournemouth.ac.uk/display/aburton\">Amber Burton</a>, a senior lecturer in digital media and communications currently researching digital identities, likens the naming of our networks to a “digital T-shirt”.</p> <p>“Remember as teens, your mates wearing those T-shirts that were designed to provoke? Always validated with a ‘it’s just a joke’, or ‘just my freedom of speech’? It’s making public something they know will provoke a reaction.”<br /></p> <p>While some router names are picked to deliberately offend, others cover everything from the deliberately arcane through to crowd-pleasing puns. Why do we pick particular names and what do these names tell us about ourselves? Burton argues that the names we then choose for ourselves serve to telegraph our identities on our own terms. “It’s all woven into the fabric of how we choose to present and represent ourselves.”<br /></p> <p>If we choose a particularly humorous name or an interesting play on language, we are broadcasting something about who we are.<br /></p> <p>But there’s a twist when it comes to network names: not only are we communicating something about ourselves via a named router, we are insisting others comply with it.<br /></p> <p>“Unusual names further extend the owner’s agenda and insists that the receiver must deal with it, by virtue of having to click on or accept a device with that handle,” Burton argues. The racist network ID in Texas isn’t just an attempt to shock, then: they’s also an attempt to normalise the attitudes through implied compliance and active collaboration.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e2790f36abec855a43a277110c868f0be52a42d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e2790f36abec855a43a277110c868f0be52a42d/0_244_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers work on their laptops in a Berlin cafe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Customers work on their laptops in a Berlin cafe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kay Nietfeld/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a bid to shed light on the tapestry of messages that invisibly permeate our world, digital marketer Federico Prandi set up <a href=\"http://www.amorequietplace.com/berlin-wi-fi/\">The Berlin Wi-Fi Project</a>: a map of Berlin overlayed with different network names. The idea came to him while trying to source a Wi-Fi connection from his phone on the train.</p> <p>“I watched the names change as the train sped through the city; some funny, some personal, some mysterious. I liked the idea of the streets being lined with a series of secret messages addressed to the universe.”<br /></p> <p>Meals’s own Wi-Fi is named EasyBox-876524. What that says about him, he suggests, is “I’m too lazy to change the name”. But his project has revealed a world of router-based innovation and wordplay. “My favourites,” Meals admits, “are the ones that broadcast something to the neighbours: ‘Please play the violin at a lower volume’, ‘It’s too loud by the convenient store” and ‘Your children are shit’.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Meals’s investigations have also revealed some strange, wordless interactions.<br /></p> <p>“In one area ’Dennis is an asshole’ is countered by ‘Dennis is no asshole’; while in my own neighbourhood “NutellaMann” and “NutellaFrau” co-exist within metres from each other. I want to believe there’s a platonic, wireless flirting going on there.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Meals and his readers work to decode the meanings of the names. A network named “Prinzessin Anabell” was discovered to be a character from an animated Czechoslovakia children’s show. A network named “Reichts Nach Genf” turned out to be a reference to a controversial graphic novel; the “genff” in the name denoting the smell of dimensional hiatus within the book’s universe.<br /></p> <p>While router names can be used to transmit something funny or personal, in the hands of hackers, things get a little dicey.</p> <p>Aaron Singer, a Service Delivery Manager at <a href=\"http://pulsaronline.com/\">Pulsar Online</a>, an internet security firm, advises on thinking twice before clicking on what appears to be a seemingly open access Wi-Fi.</p> <p>“Hackers might put up a bogus Wi-Fi hotspot, named ‘BT Openreach’ for example. You then click on it and load up your internet banking or social media, all the while using a hacker’s router which is stealing your data. </p> <p>“Hackers could even impersonate your personal router. These things happen.”</p> <p>An inquiry into some of the more unusual Wi-Fi names within my own area indeed returned some instances of trickery (“TV License Detection Unit”) alongside “Tell My Wi-Fi I Love Her” and “I Believe I Can Wi-Fi”. </p> <p>There’s one other reason for the experimentation in network names: Though there is a very modern tradition of collating <a href=\"http://bensbargains.com/thecheckout/awesomeness/50-funny-wi-fi-names-will-make-neighbors-smile/\">funny</a> and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicaprobus/no-more-free-wifi?utm_term=.jowrjxYME#.maWqxd5b0\">passive aggressive Wi-Fi network names</a>, a network name is ultimately transient. A slogan which we once found funny we soon find tedious or trite. We continually reevaluate the ways in which we want to present ourselves to the wider world. Even the racist sitting in a lecture hall in a Texas university might, one day, realise the error of their ways. And when they do, change is just a click away. </p> <p>• This article was amended on 10 January 2017 to correct the name of Federico Prandi.</p>',\n",

Amazon declined to comment.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Canterbury said he was not surprised, describing Amazon “as a pretty liberal marketer”. </p> <p>The issue was relevant, he said, because of the “amount of violence demonstrated at Black Lives Matter marches and the fact that eight police officers had been assassinated while protecting Black Lives Matter protests”.</p> <p>Canterbury said he was referring to officers who were shot in separate incidents in Dallas and Baton Rouge last summer. </p> <p>The gunmen in those shootings were not affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement. In Dallas, a gunman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/dallas-shooting-police-officers-protest-alton-sterling-philando-castile\">shot dead five officers</a> during an anti-violence protest.

Calls to the company were not answered on Friday. Owner Glenn Morelli <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/21/news/companies/walmart-black-lives-matter-shirts/\">told CNN</a>, however, that he had already decided to remove the shirt from his site.</p> <p>“It wasn’t a big seller at all,” he said. “The Blue Lives Matter sells more than the Black Lives Matter or bulletproof shirts combined. We don’t like to offend anybody.” He added: “You have to sell all different kinds of shirts. It’s hard to make everybody happy.”</p> <p>On Friday, Amazon customer reviews for “bulletproof” merchandise offered by <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NCOQXL9/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482509257&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bulletproof+black+lives+matter\">one-third party merchant</a> mirrored the divisive national debate over the Black Lives Matter movement. </p> <p>One reviewer, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3R4VG8YV3EB71/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp\">PhantomOfAmazon</a>, wrote: “The slogan is divisive &amp; misleading.

Department of Justice officials have said their new method for counting “arrest-related deaths” should improve the “reliability, validity and comprehensiveness” of such information.</p> <p>Canterbury said FOP members would continue to apply pressure on retailers to drop such merchandise, “until Black Lives Matter makes statements that they do not approve of violence”.</p> <p> </p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Brian Krebs does not use heroin, but sometimes people send it to him anyway. The 43-year-old Alabama native writes <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/\">Krebs on Security</a>, a one-man operation focused on digital crime. His encyclopedic knowledge of the subject and his network of contacts has made his blog essential reading for anyone interested in cybercrime and a coveted lecturer at some of the biggest companies in the world. It has also made him some dangerous enemies – hence the heroin, meant as a sinister, silencing message.</p> <p>Looking back on a year in which Russian cyber-spies have been accused of meddling in the US election, Yahoo announced that 1bn email accounts were compromised and hackers used internet-connected devices including baby monitors, webcams and thermostats, to take down some of the world’s biggest websites, what surprises Krebs the most is that people are surprised at all.</p> <p>The problem is cybercrime is easy, Krebs says. Too many individuals and organizations buy cheap hardware because they can’t imagine the damage millions of slightly-too-stupid routers can do; most owners of the hijacked devices that participated in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/21/ddos-attack-dyn-internet-denial-service\">the attack </a>that took down websites, including Netflix, Twitter, Reddit, CNN and PayPal, as well as the entire country of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/03/cyberattack-internet-liberia-ddos-hack-botnet\">Liberia </a>earlier this year never knew their property had been used to pull millions of computers offline.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/passwords-hacking-hashing-salting-sha-2\">Passwords and hacking: the jargon of hashing, salting and SHA-2 explained</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It’s cheap to make hardware that works,” Krebs says. It’s much more expensive to make sure it works only for you. “There are companies that have zero interest in designing a secure device; they just cobble together software libraries.”</p> <p>When laypeople write to him, Krebs says, it’s often to beg for help. “People get so frustrated and they’re scared and the clock is ticking and they don’t know what to do,” he says. “They ask where do I go? Who do I turn to?” Soon, he says, something will have to give.</p> <p>Krebs was writing <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/11/yahoo-email-stealing-exploit-fetches-700/\">about a similar bug</a> to the one Yahoo claims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/14/yahoo-hack-security-of-one-billion-accounts-breached\">compromised 1bn user accounts</a> as far back as 2012; for years he’d warned readers about “botnets” like the one that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/22/cyber-attack-hackers-weaponised-everyday-devices-with-malware-to-mount-assault\">took down the web across the eastern seaboard</a> in October.</p> <p>What shocked him, he said, was that people kept using Yahoo, and that the political establishment was “somehow surprised that Russian hackers might want to see if they could impact the direction of our election”. Of course they tried, Krebs says – it’s cheap and you don’t lose much by trying.</p> <p>Krebs earns a living dragging the perpetrators of obscure and horrifying crimes into the light: before the Washington Post laid him off, his column Security Fix <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/09/estdomains_a_sordid_history_an.html\">exposed Estonian cybercriminal Vladimir Tšaštšin</a>, whose domain-hosting business turned out to be a berth for child abusers and credit card thieves. Writing on his unshowy blog two years later, Krebs <a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/07/experts-warn-of-new-windows-shortcut-flaw/\">broke news of the notorious Stuxnet worm</a>, a tool of corporate espionage capable of intruding on anyone who used Windows.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/protect-passwords-two-step-verification-encryption-digital-life-privacy\">Eight things you need to do right now to protect yourself online</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His subjects don’t enjoy seeing their crimes written about, and sometimes they want to send him a message. In 2013, that message took the form of a gram of pure heroin taped to the back of a magazine.<br /></p> <p>That year, Krebs had earned the unwanted attention of a man calling himself The Fly, or Flycracker, later revealed to be a 26-year-old career thief named Sergey Vovnenko. Krebs tracked Vovnenko to a forum where he brokered the sale of credit card information, and found that Vovnenko was holding forth on a plan to damage Krebs’s reputation, maybe even land him in jail. </p> <p>The plan was to have heroin delivered to Krebs, then to call the police. Krebs called the police first. The heroin came a few days after he gave his statement to law enforcement; he turned it over to the cops, and went to work finding who sent it.</p> <p>Vovnenko fits a profile Krebs says applies to many in the world of information crime: young, arrogant and frankly sadistic, with a chip on his shoulder. Investigators are prone to boil credit card stealing operations and mass identity thefts to simple greed but often it’s more than that. “These guys have such huge egos,” he said. “What are they after? How much is enough? You make 100 grand a month, is that not enough? Or do you really just enjoy fucking things up and attacking people or having power over people.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jul/31/cybercrime-bitcoin-heroin-brian-krebs\">How a Russian cybercriminal tried to frame me with a Bitcoin heroin deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After Vovnenko failed to frame him, Krebs wrote about the experience in a blogpost, which the Guardian republished. He says he thinks the post embarrassed Vovnenko, who then sent Krebs’s wife <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fly-cross.jpg\">a funereal flower arrangement</a>.</p> <p>“He had it delivered to our house with a note to her, just to her, saying, ‘Dear Jennifer, you married the wrong guy, but we’ll always take care of you. Rest in peace, Brian.’ And at this point I want to know who this fucker is.”</p> <p>He found out: Vovnenko – just like the people he stole from – shared passwords between the administrator account on his identity theft forum, and the Gmail address he used to do his dirty work. Krebs learned that Vovnenko didn’t trust his fiancee and had her every keystroke logged and secretly sent to the Gmail account; in those messages was every possible personal detail about Vovnenko’s life.</p> <p>Vovnenko lived in Naples, Italy. He had a son. He married his fiancee. He bought stolen Italian credit card information, printed and embossed credit cards on machines he owned himself, and cashed the cards out through high-end Italian retailers in the fashionable city, <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/06/the-fly-has-been-swatted/#more-26555\">Krebs found</a>.</p> <p>Krebs decided to get in touch with Vovnenko. Running organized crime was one thing; a Ukrainian running an identity theft ring and printing stolen credit cards in the Camorra’s backyard was another. “I just reached out to him and said, ‘Hey, how’s Italy? How’s your son Max?’” Krebs recalls. “And he said ‘Ahahaha, I wait for FBI.’</p> <p>“I said: ‘It’s not the FBI you have to worry about.’”</p> <p>Vovnenko fell afoul of Italian authorities and spent “a while” in what he called “Naples’ worst prison” in a letter of apology he wrote to Krebs. Krebs thinks Vovnenko was in a 12-step program; he also told his victim he “forgave” him for posting a picture and Vovnenko’s address on Krebs on Security when Vovnenko was arrested.</p> <p>Criminal enterprise, especially with an eye to dominating or inflicting humiliation, tends to be the work of young men. Cybercrime is often very humiliating – Krebs recalls the Ashley Madison hack, in which thieves used the data from the cheating spouses website to write extortion letters filled with details culled from social media – another story Krebs first brought to light. “Here’s the number of the last guy who thought I was bluffing,” they said. “Call him and see if he’s happy with how it turned out.”</p> <p>Like many security researchers, Krebs says the keys to avoiding cybercrime aren’t complicated. Identity theft has largely ceased to be a matter of targeting a specific person; the responsibility for preventing it lies with irresponsible hardware manufacturers who refuse to secure their devices with basic encryption. Hardware companies are struggling to reconcile the higher cost of securing devices with the danger to billions of users that comes with cheaping out on crucial parts. Meanwhile, it’s up to users to keep track of the basics.</p> <h2>Five things you can do to avoid digital criminals</h2> <p>Like most theft, cybercrime tends to follow the path of least resistance. Here are five online hygiene tips anyone can follow, for free, to make life harder for people looking for an easy way to steal your personal or financial information.</p> <ol> <li>Use multifactor authentication, a password plus a code or a question known to you. Google’s authenticator app is a quick download and works easily with many services, including Amazon and Gmail. It’s worth checking to see if there’s a multifactor option every time a website asks you to fill out bank account or credit card information.</li> <li>Don’t share passwords across websites. Almost everyone shares at least a couple of passwords. Don’t. There are plenty of inexpensive password manager phone apps that can help you with this, notably the open-source Password Safe.</li> <li>Refuse to give up information whenever you can. Best Buy doesn’t need your phone number. The more information you part with, the more can be used against you if the retailer is hacked.</li> <li>Check your bank balance regularly. Thieves often try for a small purchase to see if the card works before they go shopping; in particular, look for easy-to-resell items like gift cards and credits on online marketplaces.</li> <li>Close down services you don’t use any more. Do you still have a Steam account from that one time you bought a PC game all your friends were talking about? Are you sure? Is it linked to a credit card you still use? These are the easiest ways for hackers to steal in bulk, and the one-off purchase you make on impulse is probably the one you’ll unthinkingly reuse your old password on, too.</li> </ol>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>The Internet of Things is here, they cried. Great, but do I really have to pull out my smartphone to do everything? Pushing a button was so much easier. Can’t I just talk to my house now? Can I scream “red alert” and have my lights flash red? The Star Trek dream.</p> <p>For decades we’ve been shown that voice is the future. From Star Trek’s computer to Iron Man’s Jarvis, science fiction has put voice control at the forefront of man-machine interaction. But until recently the best we could do was shout at a smartphone and hope for the best.</p> <p>Now there’s a new breed of AI butler available: the in-home, always-listening speakers – of which, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/21/amazon-echo-review-the-best-combined-speaker-and-voice-assistant-in-the-uk\">Amazon Echo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/28/amazon-echo-dot-review\">Echo Dot</a> are currently the pinnacle in the UK. So what is it really like to turn your house into the starship Enterprise and be able to make like <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Picard\">Captain Jean Luc Picard</a> and simply shout “Computer, lights!”? I installed five Echo Dots and one Echo speaker in my house to find out.</p> <p>The first step to inviting my new sultry-voiced AI partner into my home was to decide where to put her receptacles and what I actually wanted her to do. What you don’t realise when you start an Echo up for the first time is that you’re genuinely giving life to your house.</p> <h2>It’s life, Jim, but not as we know it</h2> <p>Alexa sounds like a person, or a house pretending to be a person, and the more you use it the more you start to think about her being built into the walls. But she isn’t. So the first job was to start dotting the Dots about the place so she practically is. Rooms are easy, hallways not so much.</p> <p>Wall-mounting was the only option. After a trip to the local DIY shop for the largest drill bit I could find, I had a hole in the wall, an Echo Dot stuck to it about chest height and the microUSB cable hooked up. A ring of lights lit up and she breathed her first words.</p> <p>“Hello.” My house was alive.</p> <p>Out of the box, Alexa has got the basics. Weather, news, timers, and facts are all covered. Asking for news gives you a Sky News flash briefing: that was the first thing that had to be changed – what would my editor think?</p> <p>Adding skills to Alexa is easy. Fire up the Alexa app, wait a bit, tap a few buttons and Bob’s your uncle. In my mind it happens a bit like in the Matrix: plug in, stick in a disc, get the operator to hit a button and hey presto “I know kung fu!”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vMO3XmNXe4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vMO3XmNXe4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>I know kung fu.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Skills added, it was time to weave Alexa’s tendrils into the various devices about my home. Lights are the obvious thing. With a bunch of Philips Hue bulbs and strip lights dotted about the home turning on the lights was a breeze. That was until you realise that the rest of your family doesn’t speak the same dork language as you.</p> <p>Each device has to have a unique name, and one you can remember without looking at an app or list.</p> <p>“Alexa, turn on the living room light”</p> <p>“I’ve found multiple lights called living room, which one did you want”</p> <p>“Err, that one”</p> <p>That’s not going to work.</p> <p>The problem is that what’s a logical name to you might not be to your significant other. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-jarvis/10154361492931634/\">Even the brains behind Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, struggled with that one</a>. You might call it the living room, someone else the lounge, maybe even the “TV room”. When you ask for a room that doesn’t exist in Alexa’s log of groups you get, “I cannot find a device or group called lounge” and blood starts to boil.</p> <p>To save mine and my family’s sanity I ended up creating as many different group names as I could think of. Lounge, living room, TV room and front room all contain the living room lights. Say any of them and Alexa knows what you mean. But there’s nothing quite as satisfying as creating a group called “bloody” for those odd occasions when you can’t figure out quite the right word combo. “Turn on the bloody lights!”</p> <p>And then what about the different lights in each room?</p> <p>Alexa struggles with numbers, so my colleague Alex Hern suggested using the Nato phonetic alphabet: alpha, bravo, charlie, delta, etc. Best to skip Echo, but the rest work. Bedroom light one, two and three became bedroom light alpha, bravo and charlie. It works, but admittedly it sounds like I’m in the middle of one of Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six games:</p> <p>“Alexa, turn on bedroom light charlie delta one-niner. Op bedtime is now in operation. I repeat, bedtime is a go.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f55d15853440c3fd5e2aafc89a6c3a6c54d8215\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f55d15853440c3fd5e2aafc89a6c3a6c54d8215/0_0_3849_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rainbow Six: Siege.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rainbow Six: Siege.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ubisoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, nothing beats the awkwardness of trying to whisper commands to your house. In the dead of night you need the landing light on to see where you’re going, so you use your inside voice to try and turn on the lights, forgetting that even if you do manage it, Alexa will confirm your action at whatever volume level was set last time you used it.</p> <p>“Alexa, turn on the landing light”</p> <p>“OK!” she screams, or better yet shouts the equivalent to “I CAN’T HEAR YOU” when your softest tones simply don’t cut it.</p> <p>Do that a couple of times and you’ll end up getting snuffed out in the middle of the night as your family seeks revenge. A button is certainly the way forward here, and the Logitech Pop switches, which like Alexa can basically control everything, are the answer, although Philips has its own switches too.</p> <h2>Shields up, red alert!</h2> <p>Alexa can command the lights to control brightness, colour and set scenes, but you quickly realise that simplicity is the key. I still can’t for the life of me remember what I called that “I’m trying to relax in the evening, but also not kill my eyes as the night draws in” mode.</p> <p>Perhaps my new intelligent home’s best trick came with the combination of IFTTT (If this then that), Alexa and some coloured Hue bulbs. If you’ve ever wanted to truly live the Star Trek dream, now you can.</p> <p>“Alexa, trigger red alert.”</p> <p>And the whole house is turned into what looks like a brothel, or a starship under attack. I haven’t hooked up a siren yet, so more brothel.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV30YwXaKJg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wV30YwXaKJg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Shields up, arm torpedos. Warp factor 8. Engage.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>OK, so you’ve got the lights down pat, what else can you do with your voice? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/04/logitech-harmony-elite-review-remote-control-home-nest-smartthings-tv-sky\">Logitech’s Harmony Hub</a> can be plugged into Alexa to turn on your TV, change the channel and that kind of thing. It works too, in a similar manner to control of an Echo speaker, that is until you “ask Harmony to turn up the volume” and you inadvertently jump 15dB from a comfortable level to ear-splittingly loud. </p> <p>Then there’s the heating. If you happen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/03/google-nest-learning-thermostat-third-generation-home-gadget-smart-heating\">have a Nest</a> or similar smart thermostat you can set the heat via voice, if you can remember what it’s called (hint: it’s the place you put it rather than the thing if you’re using a Nest).</p> <h2>So this is Christmas</h2> <p>It gets better if you happen to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/08/samsung-smartthings-hub-review-internet-of-things\"> have a SmartThings Hub lying around</a>. Anything you attach to it, which is basically anything “smart”, can be hooked up to Alexa for a bit of voice action. When is a Christmas tree not just a Christmas tree? When it can be controlled with the power of voice thanks to a smartplug.</p> <p>Add a Sonos system into the mix and with a bit of hacking with the Harmony hub and SmartThings you can even start Merry Christmas by Slade to really round off the Christmas cheer, and drive the neighbours potty.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWgwTe01kMU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cWgwTe01kMU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Forgive me.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>For the most part Alexa is good enough to know when she’s not required, but occasionally you’re having a conversation about something entirely unrelated and she’ll start up. The ring of lights pulsates, either shutting off when she realises that it’s not all about her, or interrupting with a seemingly random action or quizzing you about precisely what it was you wanted.</p> <p>“Shut up, Alexa!” and she gets the hint. You end up scolding her like you might an unruly child. And when you’re trying to talk about her, unless you’ve hit the mute button you end up going further. “She who should not be named” is what Alexa goes by in my house, but I’ve seen some spell her out like you would a sensitive subject around a child. In this case though, Alexa can’t spell, or at least can’t work out that you’re talking about her.</p> <p>Inviting an AI assistant to run my home has been one of the most rewarding tech experiments I’ve done to date, unifying the cluttered landscape of disparate devices and bringing my home to life. But it’s also caused the most grief in my family, not because it doesn’t work, or because it’s not useful, but because when you set it up, you know how to use it. The rest of your family doesn’t want to know until it becomes useful for them, and it only becomes useful when they start experimenting with it, which they won’t if it doesn’t do what they expect the first time round.</p> <p>Alexa is a massive leap forward, and is clearly the future of smart homes, just make sure you hook everything up in as many ways as you can, or you might find a couple of Echo Dots ripped from the wall and an axe through your smart speaker.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/25/how-to-sleep-better-with-technology\">How to use technology to sleep better</a><br /></strong></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/21/amazon-echo-review-the-best-combined-speaker-and-voice-assistant-in-the-uk\"><strong>Amazon Echo review: the best combined speaker and voice assistant in the UK</strong></a></li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/08/samsung-smartthings-hub-review-internet-of-things\">Samsung SmartThings Hub review: an Internet of Things to rule them all?</a><br /></strong></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/28/amazon-echo-dot-review\"><strong>Amazon Echo Dot review: as good as the Echo for one-third of the price</strong></a></li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/03/google-nest-learning-thermostat-third-generation-home-gadget-smart-heating\">Nest Learning Thermostat third-gen: the simple, effective heating gadget</a><br /></strong></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/04/logitech-harmony-elite-review-remote-control-home-nest-smartthings-tv-sky\"><strong>Logitech Harmony Elite review: easy to use remote that takes charge of your home</strong></a></li> </ul>',\n",

The unit is headed up by David Ferrucci, who previously led IBM’s development of Watson, the supercomputer that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/feb/17/ibm-computer-watson-wins-jeopardy\">beat humans at Jeopardy! in 2011</a>.</p> <p>The company is already highly data-driven, with meetings recorded and staff asked to grade each other throughout the day using a ratings system called “dots”. The Systematized Intelligence Lab has built a tool that incorporates these ratings into “Baseball Cards” that show employees’ strengths and weaknesses. Another app, dubbed The Contract, gets staff to set goals they want to achieve and then tracks how effectively they follow through.</p> <p>These tools are early applications of PriOS, the over-arching management software that Dalio wants to make three-quarters of all management decisions within five years. The kinds of decisions PriOS could make include finding the right staff for particular job openings and ranking opposing perspectives from multiple team members when there’s a disagreement about how to proceed. </p> <p>The machine will make the decisions, according to a set of principles laid out by Dalio about the company vision.</p> <p>“It’s ambitious, but it’s not unreasonable,” said <a href=\"http://www.iftf.org/devinfidler/\">Devin Fidler</a>, research director at the Institute For The Future, who has built a <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/04/heres-how-managers-can-be-replaced-by-software\">prototype management system called iCEO</a>. “A lot of management is basically information work, the sort of thing that software can get very good at.”</p> <p>Automated decision-making is appealing to businesses as it can save time and eliminate human emotional volatility. </p> <p>“People have a bad day and it then colors their perception of the world and they make different decisions. In a hedge fund that’s a big deal,” he added. </p> <p>Will people happily accept orders from a robotic manager? Fidler isn’t so sure. “People tend not to accept a message delivered by a machine,” he said, pointing to the need for a human interface. </p> <p>“In companies that are really good at data analytics very often the decision is made by a statistical algorithm but the decision is conveyed by somebody who can put it in an emotional context,” he explained. </p> <p>Futurist Zoltan Istvan, founder of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/16/transhumanist-party-immortality-zoltan-istvan-presidential-campaign\">Transhumanist party</a>, disagrees. “People will follow the will and statistical might of machines,” he said, pointing out that people already outsource way-finding to GPS or the flying of planes to autopilot.</p> <p>However, the period in which people will need to interact with a robot manager will be brief. </p> <p>“Soon there just won’t be any reason to keep us around,” Istvan said. “Sure, humans can fix problems, but machines in a few years time will be able to fix those problems even better. </p> <p>“Bankers will become dinosaurs.”</p> <p>It’s not just the banking sector that will be affected. According to a report by Accenture, artificial intelligence will free people from the drudgery of administrative tasks in many industries. The company surveyed 1,770 managers across 14 countries to find out how artificial intelligence would impact their jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/29/ipal-robot-childcare-robobusiness-san-jose\">\\'This is awful\\': robot can keep children occupied for hours without supervision</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“AI will ultimately prove to be cheaper, more efficient, and potentially more impartial in its actions than human beings,” said the authors writing up the results of the survey in <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-artificial-intelligence-will-redefine-management\">Harvard Business Review</a>.</p> <p>However, they didn’t think there was too much cause for concern. “It just means that their jobs will change to focus on things only humans can do.”</p> <p>The authors say that machines would be better at administrative tasks like writing earnings reports and tracking schedules and resources while humans would be better at developing messages to inspire the workforce and drafting strategy.</p> <p>Fidler disagrees. “There’s no reason to believe that a lot of what we think of as strategic work or even creative work can’t be substantially overtaken by software.”</p> <p>However, he said, that software will need some direction. “It needs human decision making to set objectives.”</p> <p>Bridgewater Associates did not respond to a request for comment.</p>',\n",

On Wednesday, the California department of motor vehicles announced that it was revoking the registration of the 16 cars, and Uber finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/21/uber-cancels-self-driving-car-trial-san-francisco-california\">agreed to halt the program</a>. </p> <p>“Arizona welcomes Uber self-driving cars with open arms and wide open roads,” said Arizona governor Doug Ducey in a statement. “While California puts the brakes on innovation and change with more bureaucracy and more regulation, Arizona is paving the way for new technology and new businesses.”</p> <p>Ducey, a technology enthusiast who went for a ride in a <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2016/12/19/arizonas-governor-tries-out-googles-self-driving-car/95584862/\">self-driving Waymo car on Monday</a>, tweeted several invitations for Uber to move to his state in advance of Thursday’s announcement, using the hashtag #ditchcalifornia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dougducey/status/811764550169083904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is what OVER-regulation looks like! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ditchcalifornia?src=hash\">#ditchcalifornia</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/RMbUkQY9ek\">https://t.co/RMbUkQY9ek</a></p>&mdash; Doug Ducey (@dougducey) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dougducey/status/811764550169083904\">December 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Uber will not have to violate its principles in testing self-driving vehicles in Arizona. </p> <p>“Part of what makes Arizona an ideal place for Uber and other companies to test autonomous vehicle technology is that there are no special permits or licensing required,” the state department of transportation said in a statement. “In Arizona, autonomous vehicles have the same registration requirements as any other vehicle, and nothing in state law prevents testing autonomous vehicles.”</p> <p>In August 2015, Ducey signed an executive order supporting the development and testing of autonomous vehicles in the state. The <a href=\"http://azgovernor.gov/file/2660/download?token=nLkPLRi1\">order</a> established a <a href=\"https://www.azdot.gov/about/boards-and-committees/arizona-self-driving-vehicle-oversight-committee\">committee</a> to advise state agencies on the development of necessary rules or statutes relating to self-driving cars. </p> <p>Uber already has a significant footprint in Arizona. In June 2015, the company opened a <a href=\"https://newsroom.uber.com/center-of-excellence-in-phoenix/\">customer service office</a> in Phoenix. Uber also announced a <a href=\"https://newsroom.uber.com/us-arizona/driving-innovation-in-arizona/\">partnership with the University of Arizona</a> for research on self-driving and mapping technology in August 2015. </p> <p>Arizona has one of the <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/economy/2016/09/16/poverty-rates-arizona-still-among-nations-highest/90495336/\">highest rates of poverty</a> in the country. The state has <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/jobs/2016/04/01/phoenix-area-attracting-west-coast-tech-companies/82478092/\">aggressively courted technology companies</a> looking for cheaper outposts from Silicon Valley in order to boost its economy. </p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Google grants are relied upon to pay for adverts that counter search results that appear to deny that the Holocaust happened, a Jewish heritage museum said on Wednesday.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The marketing director of the <a href=\"http://www.thebreman.org/\">Breman Museum</a> in Atlanta, Georgia said it was “nauseating” that Google algorithms directed users to a neo-Nazi site as the top result for the phrase “did the Holocaust happen?”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>He explained it cost the museum up to $2 (£1.60) a click to direct searchers to its own site via Google’s AdWords programme. The museum later made clear that the Breman is not a paid advertiser of Google, but in fact it receives a grant for free advertising from Google via its ad grants programme, which enables charitable and educational organisations like museums to apply to Google for<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/grants/\"> </a>free advertising to drive awareness and promote educational messages, up to a limit of $10,000 a month. The programme has been running for several years.</p> <p>The director of the Breman Museum, Aaron Berger, said that according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Georgia was one of the worst states in the US for active hate groups and using AdWords was an “incredibly important part of our approach in getting our site up the search results”.</p> <p>A Google spokesman said last week: “We never want to make money from searches for Holocaust denial and we don’t allow regular advertising on those terms.”</p> <p>It comes after an intense three weeks of pressure on the company regarding its search results. It has consistently refused to take responsibility for directing Google users to hate content including a neo-Nazi site, Stormfront, for a search for “did the Holocaust happen”.</p> <p>Leading academics said it was probably holding firm because to “edit” content on one subject would lead to calls to take action over other controversial topics. Frank Pasquale,<strong> </strong>professor of law at the University of Maryland, said it would be a tacit admission that it was a publishing company and not a “neutral” platform, as it maintains.</p> <p>On Tuesday, however, Google told a search industry website it had decided to make a algorithmic change to combat the problem.</p> <p>In a story, headlined Official: Google makes change, results are no longer in denial over ‘Did the Holocaust happen?’ a Google spokesman said the company had recently made “improvements to our algorithm that will help surface more high quality, credible content on the web”.</p> <p>But Barry Schwartz, the founder of Search Engine Roundtable, a long-standing industry site, said: “There is no evidence of any change to the algorithm. We track these things very carefully and there’s nothing to suggest they have done anything.”<br />When asked why he thought Google had made the announcement at this time, he said: “It just seems like it must be a PR thing. That’s the only explanation I can see.”</p> <p>Google confirmed that an algorithm change was under way. They said it was an ongoing process and would take some time to apply throughout the system. </p> <p>The said: “When non-authoritative information ranks too high in our search results, we develop scalable, automated approaches to fix the problems, rather than manually removing these one-by-one. </p> <p>“We constantly make improvements to our algorithm that help surface more high quality, credible content on the web, and will continue developing those efforts over time.”</p> <p>Schendowich of the Berman Museum said Google was critical in getting the museum’s message about the Holocaust out: “Search is everything. It’s so powerful. People don’t respond to print. If you don’t show in search you are invisible.” </p> <p>Its website does not show up on the first page of Google’s “natural” – ie not-paid for – search results for “Did the Holocaust happen”. Schendowich said the museum used very aggressive SEO techniques but it was hard because “Google is a big mystery. It’s a black box. Nobody knows how it works. Only Google.”</p> <p>The museum’s director, Aron Berger, confirmed that the museum used the grant it received from Google to help it come higher up the search results than sites such as Stormfront via AdWords by targeting certain search terms.</p> <p>Schendowich said: “We can’t afford to advertise that much because this is a very expensive search. It’s expensive because it’s popular. That’s how it works. You pay more to advertise Nike shoes than some other brand. This is the same. It’s a very hot topic and what bothers me is that a denier site is right at the top. It’s nauseating. Absolutely nauseating. I talk to so many people who survived it … it did happen. We have all the evidence. That’s what we’re doing. That’s why it’s so important.”</p> <p>A Google spokesman said: “We have no interest in profiting from sites or organisations that promote hate, which is why we ban them from using our ads systems. Under some circumstances we allow advertising against offensive terms, typically by organisations whose mission involves educating people about the issues. Those organisations can and do apply for Ad Grants – free advertising to drive awareness and promote educational messages. We give hundreds of millions of dollars worth of free advertising to non-profit organisations through our Ad Grants programme.”</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 24 December 2016. An earlier version was the subject of a complaint from Google. It stated that the museum claimed the search engine profited directly from displaying search results that denied the Holocaust through paid-for advertising.<br /></li> </ul> <p><em><br /></em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p> <p></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/17/holocaust-deniers-google-search-top-spot\">How to bump Holocaust deniers off Google’s top spot?

However, it appears that the Android app was infected with a Trojan. <br /></p> <p>CrowdStrike said open-source research suggested that during the two years of conflict, Ukrainian artillery forces lost 50% of all weaponry but over 80% of their D-30 howitzers. The higher than average loss suggests data gained from the hack was then used to target the artillery.</p> <p>Research has shown that Russia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/17/russia-shelled-ukrainians-from-within-its-own-territory-says-study\">shelled Ukraine</a> from inside its own territory, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/12/armoured-russian-vehicle-inside-ukraine\">sending weapons and troops</a> over the border. Officially, Russia denied any major role in the conflict.</p> <p>The malware was a version of the type used in the hack of the Democratic National Committee, CrowdStrike believes, making it highly likely that Fancy Bear, a hacking group believed to be based in Russia, was the culprit. “The source code to this malware has not been observed in the public domain and appears to have been developed uniquely by Fancy Bear,” CrowdStrike said.</p> <p>US intelligence officials believe Fancy Bear works on behalf of the GRU, the intelligence agency of Russia’s army. Before the attack on the DNC, the same group is believed to have interfered on behalf of Russian interests in Georgia <a href=\"https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/fireye/images/rpt-apt28.pdf\">(pdf)</a> and other countries bordering Russia.</p> <p>“This cannot be a hands-off group or a bunch of criminals. They need to be in close communication with the Russian military,” CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch told Reuters.</p> <p>US officials believe Fancy Bear and other Russian hackers intervened in the election, with the aim of giving an advantage to Donald Trump. Both Fancy Bear and another supposedly Russian hacking group named Cozy Bear had hacked the DNC servers, according to analysts, without knowing about each other.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin has dismissed the allegations as “hysteria”, while Trump himself has also rubbished the US intelligence assessment in recent days. But the new allegations, if proved, would make it harder to distance the activities of the hackers from the Russian state. </p> <p></p> <p>“CrowdStrike have been pretty reliable in the past, and their reports about the bears were independently verified,” said Andrei Soldatov, co-author of the Red Web, a recent book about the Russian internet. He said: “This doesn’t mean Fancy Bear is GRU: it could be, but not necessarily. But I think this new information means Fancy Bear is more incorporated into the Russian state than I might have thought before, and works with the military.”</p> <p>However, Yaroslav Sherstyuk, the Ukrainian military officer who developed the app, wrote on Facebook that the report was “total nonsense”. He said he was personally in control of downloads of the app and that they were not compromised, suggesting the report itself might be a way to spread panic among Ukrainian military units. <br /></p>',\n",

Other incidents, such as the removal of a famous Vietnam war image have seen its decisions questioned.</p> <p>Facebook recently employed editors to curate its trending news feed – a small box that contains headlines and a small summary of current affairs being discussed across the platform.

       "    'fields': {'body': '<blockquote> <p>My daughter has asked for a Windows laptop for Christmas, for schoolwork and games. I used to follow the same procedure when setting up a PC for the first time: I’d install AVG anti-virus, Zone Alarm, CCleaner, Spybot Search and Destroy etc. I’m a Mac user and haven’t set up a Windows machine for many years so I’d appreciate any advice … except “get her a Mac/Linux” from below the line! <strong>Stuart</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Windows 10 already includes almost everything the average PC user needs, with three different types of software. First, there are traditional Windows programs such as WordPad. Second, there are new-style apps such as Mail and Sticky Notes. Third, there are in-browser programs that work with your log-on email address, which is your Microsoft Account.</p> <p>Traditional programs are usually the most powerful but also the most dangerous. They should only be downloaded from the original source (the software company) or a trusted alternative, such as <a href=\"http://www.majorgeeks.com/mg/topdownloads/index.html\">Major Geeks</a> or <a href=\"https://ninite.com/\">Ninite</a>. </p> <p>New-style apps are downloaded and maintained from a trusted source, the Windows Store, and they run in sandboxes that prevent them from doing bad things. There are apps for Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, Netflix, Shazam, Deezer, Pinterest, Twitter, TuneIn Radio etc (but not Snapchat), plus loads of games.</p> <p>Online apps are useful if you have a good internet connection. Windows 10 includes online versions of OneNote, Word, Excel and PowerPoint from Microsoft Office. The online programs often have their own apps as well, including apps for Android and Apple smartphones and tablets.</p> <p>In general, it’s only worth installing things that are better than the bundled programs, but it depends on personal preferences and circumstances. For example, I used to recommend Evernote and Dropbox, and now I don’t. Today, OneNote is better than Evernote, and OneNote is widely used in schools. Dropbox is better than OneDrive, but OneDrive offers more free storage (5GB vs 2GB) and is good enough. Of course, many people already have data in Evernote and Dropbox, but for the rest of us, they’re optional.</p> <h2><strong>Windows 10 security</strong></h2> <p>Security has been a major concern because some earlier versions of Windows – especially XP – were very insecure. That has changed. Windows 10’s security has improved so much that the <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/688721/dod-wide-windows-10-rapid-deployment-to-boost-cybersecurity\">US Defense Department</a> is moving to it as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Windows 10 is safe enough to use without any extra security software, if you keep the latest default settings. These include SmartScreen filter, which checks web addresses for known malware, and a cloud-based service, which was turned on by default in the Anniversary Update edition. If Defender sees a suspicious file that it does not recognise, it refers it to the cloud service, which uses heuristics, automated file analysis and machine learning to decide whether or not to block it. This is important with things like ransomware attacks.</p> <p>People who block Windows 10’s background security and telemetry communications – perhaps in a misguided attempt to protect their privacy – risk compromising their security. If so, they should install an alternative anti-virus program that makes exactly the same checks, and uses its own cloud services for exactly the same purposes.</p> <p>The combination of Defender, SmartScreen and cloud-based heuristics should be OK for users who don’t have dangerous surfing habits, especially if they use secure browsers, such as Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome. My wife is in this category. I’m paranoid so I supplement Defender with <a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/\">MalwareBytes Anti-Malware</a> and occasional scans with <a href=\"http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/adwcleaner.html\">Adware Cleaner</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hitmanpro.com/en-us/hmp.aspx\">Hitman Pro</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gmer.net/\">GMER</a>. (They’ve not found anything yet.)</p> <p>There are, of course, better anti-virus products than Defender, both free and paid-for. I usually install <a href=\"https://www.avast.com/windows-10-antivirus\">Avast</a> on other people’s PCs after removing a virus, but Avira, Bitdefender and Kaspersky are good alternatives. (Avast now owns AVG.) Kaspersky and Bitdefender seem to be the best paid-for AV suites.</p> <p>I also install Flexera’s free <a href=\"https://www.flexerasoftware.com/enterprise/products/software-vulnerability-management/personal-software-inspector/\">Personal Software Inspector</a>. This monitors your PC’s software and tells you which programs are insecure and need updating. In some cases, it will even update them for you.</p> <p>PSI is important because most vulnerabilities are now in third-party programs such as Adobe Reader, Flash, Oracle Java and so on, not in Windows. A PC may have dozens of programs from dozens of suppliers, and even if you knew which ones needed security patches, it would be tedious to update them. PSI solves that problem nicely.</p> <h2><strong>Browser choice</strong></h2> <p>Windows 10 includes two browsers: the new Edge and the old Internet Explorer 11. Edge is a good browser: it’s secure, fast and light. However, it still has some weird omissions (can’t save pages!) and <a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions/\">very few extensions</a> (about 20). IE11 is best avoided, unless a website only works in IE. So, you probably need another browser....</p> <p>The main alternatives are <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/browser/desktop/\">Google Chrome</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/\">Firefox</a>. Chrome is more secure but it guzzles memory, resources and battery power, so I generally use Firefox with the <a href=\"https://www.ghostery.com/try-us/download-browser-extension/\">Ghostery</a> and <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/\">uBlock Origin</a> extensions. Instead of Chrome, I use <a href=\"https://vivaldi.com/?lang=en\">Vivaldi</a>, which is slow to load, a bit geeky – sorry, aimed at “power users” – and still being developed. Vivaldi is, like Chrome, based on the open source <a href=\"https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium\">Chromium browser</a>, and it runs most Chrome extensions.</p> <p>There are lots of <a href=\"https://www.raymond.cc/blog/chromium-browser-alternatives-with-extra-features/\">Chromium-based browsers</a>, including Opera.</p> <h2><strong>Useful utilities</strong></h2> <p>There are a few free programs that I install on most PCs because they’re generally useful. These are: Unchecky, Search Everything, Paint.net, PIXresizer, FreeFileSync, and the K-Lite codec pack. Windows 10’s much improved Task Manager (WinKey-X, T) means there’s less need for <a href=\"https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processexplorer.aspx\">Process Explorer</a>. To those, I might add CCleaner, Revo Uninstaller or SlimCleaner, but I usually don’t.</p> <p><a href=\"https://unchecky.com/\">Unchecky</a> is a simple program that unchecks tick-boxes. When you download a free Windows program, the supplier will often try to foist some unwanted software on you, such as Google Chrome. It’s how they make money. Unchecky unchecks all the boxes in case you miss them.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.voidtools.com/\">Search Everything</a> is a fast way to find and open files if you can’t quite remember their names or where you put them. It doesn’t search inside files, so it doesn’t spend a lot of time and resources on indexing.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.getpaint.net/index.html\">Paint.net</a> is a replacement for Microsoft Paint, and it’s good for editing photos and images. It can, of course, resize images too, but Bluefive’s <a href=\"http://bluefive.pair.com/free_computer_software.htm\">PIXresizer</a> is super-efficient at reducing file sizes. It also does batch conversions so you can process whole folders of photos before uploading them to Facebook, or whatever.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.freefilesync.org/\">FreeFileSync</a> is a fast way to synchronise two sets of files: one on your PC and the other on an external hard drive or other target. It doesn’t replace full backups, but it’s a really useful way to keep uncompressed, instantly accessible copies of important photos and documents.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm\">The K-Lite codec pack</a> is a bundle of decoders that will play most of the video and audio files you can find on the net. The standard version includes a lightweight media player – Media Player Classic Home Cinema (MPC-HC) – that looks like an old Microsoft product but isn’t. The main alternative is <a href=\"http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.en_GB.html\">VLC</a>, which also runs on MacOS and Linux.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download\">CCleaner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html\">Revo Uninstaller</a> and <a href=\"https://www.slimwareutilities.com/slimcleaner.php\">SlimCleaner</a> all include clean-up routines and utilities to uninstall programs and manage hard drives. Such programs were popular with Windows XP users, but they’re not as useful with Windows 10, unless you need to recover some disk space in a hurry. If so, they’ll delete old logs, cookies, temporary internet files and so on. Just make sure you have backups, that you know all your log-on IDs and passwords, and that you’ve saved your browser tabs with, for example, <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/session-manager/\">Session Manager</a>.</p> <p>Of the three, I’d pick Revo Uninstaller, but they all need to be used with care.</p> <p>There’s a long and honourable tradition of messing about with Windows, and some versions have needed it. But the days of Windows 95 and XP have long gone. Windows 10 generally works perfectly well if left to do its thing, and the less tinkering, the better. If it goes badly wrong, you can simply <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options\">re-set it</a>.</p> <p><strong>Have you got another question for Jack?

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>This Christmas, don’t expect to see Sir David Attenborough balancing an octopus on top of a warthog while trying to mate a toucan with a shark. Although if the BBC needs a festive ratings boost, it’s a thought.</p> <p>You might see it happen on your kitchen table, though, if you own <a href=\"http://beastsofbalance.com/\">Beasts of Balance</a>. The new augmented board game sits somewhere in between Jenga and Skylanders, with your efforts to build a tower of animals reflected in the digital world of its companion app.</p> <p>The £69 game started life as a project called Fabulous Beasts, co-created by a group of eight to 12 year olds with a British startup called Sensible Objects. One <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sensibleobject/fabulous-beasts-a-new-kind-of-game\">£168k crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter</a> later – plus a name change after a trademark run-in with the Hollywood Studio behind the Fantastic Beasts film – and Beasts of Balance was born.</p> <p>The aim of the game is to build your tower of animals as high as possible. In the box, you get a battery-powered plinth on top of which you build your stack, an NFC reader to “scan” the Beasts of Balance pieces, and Bluetooth to connect to the companion app for Android or iOS.</p> <p>You also get a set of durable plastic “artefacts” including six beasts: a bear, an eagle, a shark, a warthog, a toucan and an octopus. They’re colourful and deliberately minimalist representations of the animals, similar to the characters in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/12/mobile-game-crossy-road-uk\">Crossy Road</a>, but less blocky.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de6ebe2a2da8bad99384dd52ffff228fe0ccef34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de6ebe2a2da8bad99384dd52ffff228fe0ccef34/0_133_2000_1201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beasts of Balance blends physical and digital gameplay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beasts of Balance blends physical and digital gameplay.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other pieces include crosses and “migration” arrows; elemental artefacts representing combinations of fire, earth, water and air; and “miracle” artefacts that are this game’s equivalent of power-ups.</p> <h2>Single or multiplayer games</h2> <p>Whether you’re playing alone or with others, Beasts of Balance involves stacking the artefacts one at a time to form a tower on top of the plinth, with the twist that as you place them, they appear and have an effect on-screen in the app.</p> <p>For example, in a two-player game: if the first player scans then places the bear; the second scans then balances the octopus on top of it; and then the first player scans and balances a cross artefact, the two beasts spawn a Pawpoise, which is a combination of the two.</p> <p>Play progresses from there: the on-screen beasts have a semi-random number of points attached to them, which decrease if a beast is subsequently played that scores a higher number of points. Lower beast scores can be increased by using matching elemental artefacts, such as earth for the land dwelling bear, to try and boost their scores past the highest ranked animal.</p> <p>The fun comes from finding out what different combinations of beasts and other artefacts do, with new animals stored in the app’s built-in bestiary to track your progress.</p> <p>When the stack topples, you have a few seconds to reconstruct it before an on-screen volcano erupts, but if you fail it’s game over – and a check to see if your points total beat your previous best effort.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raubUjZbMJc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/raubUjZbMJc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>Dragging screen-glued kids into the augmented world</h2> <p>Beasts of Balance is designed as a family game that appeals to the current generation of kids who’ve grown up with tablets, but which also draws them out into tabletop cooperative gameplay with physical objects.</p> <p>Is the core gameplay mechanic enough to keep those children interested beyond the first few games? It has been for my seven- and nine year-old sons, although not for the reason I expected.</p> <p>They’re quite interested in filling empty slots in Beasts of Balance’s bestiary, but much keener on uncovering new and better ways to stack its beasts and artefacts, trying new orientations and combinations to build ever-bigger and more-stable stacks.</p> <p>The cooperative gameplay is one of Beasts of Balance’s selling points, certainly for parents looking for a game to get their family round a table working together, rather than sparking arguments from over-competitive instincts.</p> <p>The flipside here is that when my two children were playing together, they still managed to argue – usually about whose “fault” it was when the stack toppled.</p> <p>To put it another way, in a two-player game of Jenga, when one player topples the tower, the other player is the winner, and happy. In a two-player game of Beasts of Balance, the risk is that when the stack falls, both players are furious.</p> <p>Whether that says more about the inability of my sons to lose graciously rather than a failing in Beasts of Balance I’m not sure.</p> <p>Sensible Objects has a few ideas to keep the game interesting in the longer term. It’s already selling two new beasts as £15 add-ons: the “<a href=\"http://beastsofbalance.com/product/the-omnibeast/\">Omnibeast</a>” and the “<a href=\"http://beastsofbalance.com/product/the-lalnalion/\">Lalnalion</a>” – the latter designed by YouTube gaming crew Yogscast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1bf939439a7ad2e03e54736cf15985d27d44aff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1bf939439a7ad2e03e54736cf15985d27d44aff/0_179_1197_931/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New artefacts like the Lalnalion will bring new gameplay to Beasts of Balance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"778\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New artefacts like the Lalnalion will bring new gameplay to Beasts of Balance.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There’s also a £20 “DIY Artefacts” pack of RFID tags, which children can stick to their own toys to make them part of the game. Future updates to the app could also add new gameplay modes, including a more competitive option.</p> <p>Beasts of Balance isn’t cheap at £69, so that ability for digital updates to breathe more life into its physical components will be important if it’s to provide value for money in the longer term.</p> <p>The price may put some parents off what is an unknown brand, but early adopters will find lots to enjoy in Beasts of Balance – not to mention getting a sense of how digital and physical play can interweave in a way that gets families laughing together, rather than staring into separate screens.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>The eternal human struggle to live meaningfully in the face of inevitable death entered its newest phase one Monday in the summer of 2007, when employees of Google gathered to hear a talk by a writer and self-avowed geek named Merlin Mann. Their biggest professional problem was email, the digital blight that was colonising more and more of their hours, squeezing out time for more important work, or for having a life. And Mann, a rising star of the “personal productivity” movement, seemed like he might have found the answer.</p> <p>He called his system “Inbox Zero”, and the basic idea was simple enough. Most of us get into bad habits with email: we check our messages every few minutes, read them and feel vaguely stressed about them, but take little or no action, so they pile up into an even more stress-inducing heap. Instead, Mann advised his audience that day at Google’s Silicon Valley campus, every time you visit your inbox, you should systematically “process to zero”. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/20/email-overload-tips-control-inbox\">Clarify the action each message requires</a> – a reply, an entry on your to-do list, or just filing it away. Perform that action. Repeat until no emails remain. Then close your inbox, and get on with living.</p> <p>“It was really just a way of saying, ‘I suck at email, and here’s stuff that makes me suck less at it – you may find it useful,’” Mann recalled later. But he had stumbled on a rich seam of societal anxiety. Hundreds of thousands of people watched his talk online, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/jan/13/email-empty-inbox-zero-labels-guide\">Inbox Zero</a> spawned countless blog posts, along with books and apps. It was the Atkins diet for nerds: if you weren’t doing it yourself, you almost certainly knew someone who was. Mann’s followers triumphantly posted screenshots of their empty inboxes; the New Yorker, discerning his increasingly cult-like following, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/zero-dark-inbox\">described his system as</a> “halfway between Scientology and Zen”. (The New York Post <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/05/20/the-path-to-happiness-is-ignoring-emails-not-deleting-them/\">called it bullshit</a>.)</p> <p>If all this fervour seems extreme – Inbox Zero was just a set of technical instructions for handling email, after all – this was because email had become far more than a technical problem. It functioned as a kind of infinite to-do list, to which anyone on the planet could add anything at will. For the “knowledge workers” of the digital economy, it was both metaphor and delivery mechanism for the feeling that the pressure of trying to complete an ever-increasing number of tasks, in a finite quantity of time, was becoming impossible to bear.</p> <p>Most of us have experienced this creeping sense of being overwhelmed: the feeling not merely that our lives are full of activity – that can be exhilarating – but that time is slipping out of our control. And today, the personal productivity movement that Mann helped launch – which promises to ease the pain with time-management advice tailored to the era of smartphones and the internet – is flourishing as never before. There are now thousands of apps in the “productivity” category of the Apple app store, including software to simulate the ambient noise of working in a coffee shop (this has been shown, in psychology experiments, to help people focus on work), and a text editor that deletes the words you have written if you don’t keep typing fast enough.</p> <p>The quest for increased personal productivity – for making the best possible use of your limited time – is a dominant motif of our age. Two books on the topic by the New York Times journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/27/think-big-tasks-ambitions-creativity-smarter-faster-better-charles-duhigg\">Charles Duhigg</a> have spent more than 60 weeks on the US bestseller lists between them, and the improbable titular promise of another book, The Four Hour Work Week, has seduced a reported 1.35m readers worldwide. There are blogs offering tips on productive dating, and on the potential result of productive dating, productive parenting; signs have been spotted in American hotels wishing visitors a “productive stay”. The archetypal Silicon Valley startup, in the last few years, has been one that promises to free up time and mental capacity by eliminating some irritating “friction” of daily life – shopping or laundry, or even eating, in the case of the sludgy, beige meal replacement Soylent – almost always for the purpose of doing more work.</p> <p>And yet the truth is that more often than not, techniques designed to enhance one’s personal productivity seem to exacerbate the very anxieties they were meant to allay. The better you get at managing time, the less of it you feel that you have. Even when people did successfully implement Inbox Zero, it didn’t reliably bring calm. Some interpreted it to mean that every email deserved a reply, which only shackled them more firmly to their inboxes. (“That drives me crazy,” Mann says.) Others grew jumpy at the thought of any messages cluttering an inbox that was supposed to stay pristine, and so ended up checking more frequently. My own dismaying experience with Inbox Zero was that becoming hyper-efficient at processing email meant I ended up getting more email: after all, it’s often the case that replying to a message generates a reply to that reply, and so on. (By contrast, negligent emailers often discover that forgetting to reply brings certain advantages: people find alternative solutions to the problems they were nagging you to solve, or the looming crisis they were emailing about never occurs.)</p> <p>The allure of the doctrine of time management is that, one day, everything might finally be under control. Yet work in the modern economy is notable for its limitlessness. And if the stream of incoming emails is endless, Inbox Zero can never bring liberation: you’re still Sisyphus, rolling his boulder up that hill for all eternity – you’re just rolling it slightly faster.</p> <p>Two years after his Google talk, Mann released a rambling and slightly manic <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/6167737\">online video</a> in which he announced that he had signed a contract for an Inbox Zero book. But his career as a productivity guru had begun to stir an inner conflict. “I started making pretty good money from it” – from speaking and consulting – “but I also started to feel terrible,” he told me earlier this year. “This topic of productivity induces the <em>worst</em> kind of procrastination, because it feels like you’re doing work, but I was producing stuff that had the express purpose of saying to people, ‘Look, come and see how to do your work, rather than doing your work!’”</p> <p>The book missed its publication date. Fans started asking questions. Then, after two more years, Mann published <a href=\"http://www.merlinmann.com/media/2011/4/22/essay-cranking.html\">a self-lacerating essay</a> in which he abruptly announced that he was jettisoning the project. It was the 3,000-word howl of a man who had suddenly grasped the irony of missing morning after morning with his three-year-old daughter because he was “typing bullshit that I hoped would please my book editor” about how to use time well. He was guilty, he declared, of “abandoning [my] priorities to write about priorities … I’ve unintentionally ignored my own counsel to never let your hard work fuck up the good things.” He hinted that he might write a different kind of book instead – a book about stuff that really mattered – but it never appeared. “I’m mostly out of the productivity racket these days,” Mann told me. “If you’re just using efficiency to jam more and more stuff into your day … well, how would you ever know that that’s working?”</p> <p>It’s understandable that we respond to the ratcheting demands of modern life by trying to make ourselves more efficient. But what if all this efficiency just makes things worse?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c990981b555d1eaf9da6cc45546fbec503b54324\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c990981b555d1eaf9da6cc45546fbec503b54324/97_116_1331_1113/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Pete Gamlen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"836\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Pete Gamlen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Given that the average lifespan<strong> </strong>consists of only about 4,000 weeks, a certain amount of anxiety about using them well is presumably inevitable: we’ve been granted the mental capacities to make infinitely ambitious plans, yet almost no time at all to put them into practice. The problem of how to manage time, accordingly, goes back at least to the first century AD, when the Roman philosopher Seneca wrote On The Shortness of Life. “This space that has been granted to us rushes by so speedily, and so swiftly that all save a very few find life at an end just when they are getting ready to live,” he said, chiding his fellow citizens for wasting their days on pointless busyness, and “baking their bodies in the sun”.</p> <p>Clearly, then, the challenge of how to live our lives well is not a new one. Still, it is safe to say that the citizens of first-century Rome didn’t experience the equivalent of today’s productivity panic. (Seneca’s answer to the question of how to live had nothing to do with becoming more productive: it was to give up the pursuit of wealth or high office, and spend your days philosophising instead.) What is uniquely modern about our fate is that we feel obliged to respond to the pressure of time by making ourselves as efficient as possible – even when doing so fails to bring the promised relief from stress.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is either impossible, or at least usually feels impossible, to cut down on work in exchange for more time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The time-pressure problem was always supposed to get better as society advanced, not worse. In 1930, John Maynard Keynes famously predicted that within a century, economic growth would mean that we would be working no more than 15 hours per week – whereupon humanity would face its greatest challenge: that of figuring out how to use all those empty hours. Economists still argue about exactly why things turned out so differently, but the simplest answer is “capitalism”. Keynes seems to have assumed that we would naturally throttle down on work once our essential needs, plus a few extra desires, were satisfied. Instead, we just keep finding new things to need. Depending on your rung of the economic ladder, it’s either impossible, or at least usually feels impossible, to cut down on work in exchange for more time.</p> <p>Arguably the first time management guru – the progenitor of the notion that personal productivity might be the answer to the problem of time pressure – was Frederick Winslow Taylor,<strong> </strong>an<strong> </strong>engineer hired in 1898 by the Bethlehem Steel Works, in Pennsylvania, with a mandate to improve the firm’s efficiency. “Staring out over an industrial yard that covered several square miles of the Pennsylvania landscape, he watched as labourers loaded 92lb [iron bars] on to rail cars,” writes Matthew Stewart, in his book The Management Myth. “There were 80,000 tons’ worth of iron bars, which were to be carted off as fast as possible to meet new demand sparked by the Spanish-American war. Taylor narrowed his eyes: there was waste here, he was certain.”</p> <p>The Bethlehem workers, Taylor calculated, were shifting about 12.5 tons of iron per man per day – but predictably, when he offered a group of “large, powerful Hungarians” some extra cash to work as fast as they could for an hour, he found that they performed much better. Extrapolating to a full work day, and guesstimating time for breaks, Taylor concluded, with his trademark blend of self-confidence and woolly maths, that every man ought to be shifting 50 tons per day – four times their usual amount.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Workers were naturally unhappy at this transparent attempt to pay them the same money for more work, but Taylor was not especially concerned with their happiness; their job was to implement, not understand, his new philosophy of “scientific management”. “One of the very first requirements for a man who is fit to handle pig iron,” wrote Taylor, is “that he shall be so stupid and phlegmatic that he more nearly resembles in his mental makeup the ox than any other type … he is so stupid that the word ‘percentage’ has no meaning for him.”</p> <p>The idea of efficiency that Taylor sought to impose on Bethlehem Steel was borrowed from the mechanical engineers of the industrial revolution. It was a way of thinking about improving the functioning of machines, now transferred to humans. And it caught on: Taylor enjoyed a high-profile career as a lecturer on the topic, and by 1915, according to the historian Jennifer Alexander, “the word ‘efficiency’ was plastered everywhere – in headlines, advertisements, editorials, business manuals, and church bulletins.” In the first decades of the 20th century, in a Britain panicked by the rise of German power, the National Efficiency movement united politicians on left and right. (“At the present time,” the Spectator noted in 1902, “there is a universal outcry for efficiency in all the departments of society, in all aspects of life.”)</p> <p>It is not hard to grasp the appeal: efficiency was the promise of doing what you already did, only better, more cheaply, and in less time. What could be wrong with that? Unless you happened to be on the sharp end of attempts to treat humans like machines – like the workers of Bethlehem Steel – there wasn’t an obvious downside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"29b7196cd3e213dda07c7aaab8605edbdca80b12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29b7196cd3e213dda07c7aaab8605edbdca80b12/98_70_2528_1933/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Pete Gamlen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"765\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Pete Gamlen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>But as the century progressed, something important changed: we all became Frederick Winslow Taylors, presiding ruthlessly over our own lives. As the doctrine of efficiency grew entrenched – as the ethos of the market spread to more and more aspects of society, and life became more individualistic – we internalised it. In Taylor’s day, efficiency had been primarily a way to persuade (or bully) other people to do more work in the same amount of time; now it is a regimen that we impose on ourselves.</p> <p>According to legend, Taylorism first crossed the threshold into personal productivity when Charles Schwab, the president of Bethlehem Steel, asked another consultant, a businessman named Ivy Lee, to improve his executives’ efficiency as well. Lee advised those white-collar workers to make nightly to-do lists, arranging tomorrow’s six most important tasks by priority, then to start at the top of the list next morning, working down. It’s a stretch to imagine that nobody had thought of this before. But the story goes that when Lee told Schwab to test it for three months, then pay him what he thought it was worth, the steel magnate wrote him a cheque worth more than $400,000 in today’s money – and the time management industry was up and running.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In an era of insecure employment, we must constantly demonstrate our usefulness through frenetic doing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other gurus were to follow, writing bestsellers that modified Lee’s basic technique to incorporate the setting of long-term goals (the 1973 book How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life, by Alan Lakein, who boasted of having advised both IBM and Gloria Steinem, and who inspired a young Bill Clinton) and spiritual values (The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, published in 1989 by the Mormon efficiency expert Stephen Covey).</p> <p>Time management promised a sense of control in a world in which individuals – decreasingly supported by the social bonds of religion or community – seemed to lack it. In an era of insecure employment, we must constantly demonstrate our usefulness through frenetic doing, and time management can give you a valuable edge. Indeed, if you are among the growing ranks of the self-employed, as a freelancer or a worker in the so-called gig economy, increased personal efficiency may be essential to your survival. The only person who suffers financially if you indulge in “loafing” – a workplace vice that Taylor saw as theft – is you.</p> <p>Above all, time management promises that a meaningful life might still be possible in this profit-driven environment, as Melissa Gregg explains in Counterproductive, a forthcoming history of the field. With the right techniques, the prophets of time management all implied, you could fashion a fulfilling life while simultaneously attending to the ever-increasing demands of your employer. This promise “comes back and back, in force, whenever there’s an economic downturn”, Gregg told me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4041d905b85248b7e475e7428dacda9da752c209\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4041d905b85248b7e475e7428dacda9da752c209/0_0_327_1206/271.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Pete Gamlen\" width=\"271\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Pete Gamlen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Especially at the higher-paid end of the employment spectrum, time management whispers of the possibility of something even more desirable: true peace of mind. “It is possible for a person to have an overwhelming number of things to do and still function productively with a clear head and a positive sense of relaxed control,” the contemporary king of the productivity gurus, David Allen, declared in his 2001 bestseller, Getting Things Done. “You <em>can </em>experience what the martial artists call a ‘mind like water’, and top athletes refer to as ‘the zone’.”</p> <p>As Gregg points out, it is significant that “personal productivity” puts the burden of reconciling these demands squarely on our shoulders as individuals. Time management gurus rarely stop to ask whether the task of merely staying afloat in the modern economy – holding down a job, paying the mortgage, being a good-enough parent – really <em>ought</em> to require rendering ourselves inhumanly efficient in the first place.</p> <p>Besides, on closer inspection, even the lesser promises of time management were not all they appeared to be. An awkward truth about Taylor’s celebrated efficiency drives is that they were not very successful: Bethlehem Steel fired him in 1901, having paid him vast sums without any clearly detectable impact on its own profits. (One persistent consequence of his schemes was that they seemed promising at first, but left workers too exhausted to function consistently over the long term.)</p> <p>Likewise, it remains the frequent experience of those who try to follow the advice of personal productivity gurus – I’m speaking from years of experience here – that a “mind like water” is far from the guaranteed result. As with Inbox Zero, so with work in general: the more efficient you get at ploughing through your tasks, the faster new tasks seem to arrive. (“Work expands to fill the time available for its completion,” as the British historian C Northcote Parkinson realised way back in 1955, when he coined what would come to be known as Parkinson’s law.)</p> <p>Then there’s the matter of self-consciousness: virtually every time management expert’s first piece of advice is to keep a detailed log of your time use, but doing so just heightens your awareness of the minutes ticking by, then lost for ever. As for focusing on your long-term goals: the more you do that, the more of your daily life you spend feeling vaguely despondent that you have not yet achieved them. Should you manage to achieve one, the satisfaction is strikingly brief – then it’s time to set a new long-term goal. The supposed cure just makes the problem worse.</p> <p>There is a historical parallel for all this: it’s exactly what happened when the spread of “labour-saving” devices transformed the lives of housewives and domestic servants across Europe and north America from the end of the 19th century. Technology now meant that washing clothes no longer entailed a day bent over a mangle; a vacuum-cleaner could render a carpet spotless in minutes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The 2016 Time Matters conference was sparsely attended because it was August, and lots of people were on holiday</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet as the historian Ruth Cowan demonstrates in her 1983 book More Work for Mother, the result, for much of the 20th century, was not an increase in leisure time among those charged with doing the housework. Instead, as the efficiency of housework increased, so did the standards of cleanliness and domestic order that society came to expect. Now that the living-room carpet could be kept perfectly clean, it had to be; now that clothes never needed to be grubby, grubbiness was all the more taboo. These days, you can answer work emails in bed at midnight. So should that message you got at 5.30pm really wait till morning for a reply?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>One boiling weekend last summer,<strong> </strong>the impassioned members of a campaign group named Take Back Your Time gathered in a university lecture hall in Seattle, to further their longstanding mission of “eliminating the epidemic of overwork” – and, in so doing, to explore what it might mean to live a life that is not so focused on personal productivity. The 2016 Time Matters conference was a sparsely attended affair, in part because, as the organisers conceded, it was August, and lots of people were on holiday, and America’s most enthusiastically pro-relaxation organisation was hardly going to complain about that. But it was also because, these days, being even modestly anti-productivity – especially in the US – counts as a subversive stance. It is not the kind of platform that lends itself to glitzy mega-events with generous corporate sponsorship and effective marketing campaigns.</p> <p>The conference-goers discussed schemes for a four-day working week, for abolishing daylight savings time, for holding elections at the weekend, and generally for making America more like countries such as Italy and Denmark. (To be a critic of America’s work culture is to constantly gaze longingly across the Atlantic, at semi-mythical versions of Scandinavia and southern Europe.) But the members of Take Back Your Time were calling for something more radical than merely more time off. They sought to question our whole instrumental attitude towards time – the very idea that “getting more done” ought to be our focus in the first place. “You keep hearing people arguing that more time off might be good for the economy,” said John de Graaf, the not-even-slightly-relaxed 70-year-old filmmaker who is the organisation’s driving force. “But why should we have to justify <em>life</em> in terms of the <em>economy</em>? It makes no sense!”</p> <p>One of the sneakier pitfalls of an efficiency-based attitude to time is that we start to feel pressured to use our leisure time “productively”, too – an attitude which implies that enjoying leisure for its own sake, which you might have assumed was the whole point of leisure, is somehow not quite enough. And so we find ourselves, for example, travelling to unfamiliar places not for the sheer experience of travel, but in order to add to our mental storehouse of experiences, or to our Instagram feeds. We go walking or running to improve our health, not for the pleasure of movement; we approach the tasks of parenthood with a fixation on the successful future adults we hope to create.</p> <p>In his 1962 book The Decline of Pleasure, the critic Walter Kerr noticed this shift in our experience of time: “We are all of us compelled to read for profit, party for contracts, lunch for contacts … and stay home for the weekend to rebuild the house.” Even rest and recreation, in a culture preoccupied with efficiency, can only be understood as valuable insofar as they are useful for some other purpose – usually, recuperation, so as to enable more work. (Several conference guests mentioned Arianna Huffington’s current crusade to encourage people to get more sleep; for her, it seems, the main point of rest is to excel at the office.)</p> <p>If all this increased efficiency brings none of the benefits it was supposed to bring, what should we be doing instead? At Take Back Your Time, the consensus was that personal lifestyle changes would never suffice: reform would have to start with policies on vacation, maternity leave and overtime. But in the meantime, we might try to get more comfortable with not being as efficient as possible – with declining certain opportunities, disappointing certain people, and letting certain tasks go undone. Plenty of unpleasant chores are essential to survival. But others are not – we have just been conditioned to assume that they are. It isn’t compulsory to earn more money, achieve more goals, realise our potential on every dimension, or fit more in. In a quiet moment in Seattle, Robert Levine, a social psychologist from California, quoted the environmentalist Edward Abbey: “Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"99f44b6c22dc2cc74a71944c0dbf74da3e67016f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99f44b6c22dc2cc74a71944c0dbf74da3e67016f/56_78_1306_1925/678.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Pete Gamlen\" width=\"678\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Pete Gamlen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Yet if the ethos of efficiency and productivity risks prioritising the health of the economy over the happiness of humans, it is also true that the sense of pressure it fosters is not much good for business, either. This, it turns out, is a lesson business is not especially keen to learn.</p> <p>“After years of consulting with Microsoft, I was suddenly persona non grata,” Tom DeMarco told me, with a note of amusement in his voice. DeMarco is a minor legend in the world of software engineering. He began his career at Bell Telephone Labs, birthplace of the laser and transistor, and later became an expert in managing complex software projects, a field notorious for spiralling costs, missed deadlines, and clashing egos. But then, in the 1980s, he committed heresy: he started arguing that ramping up the time pressure on your employees was a terrible way to drive such projects forward. What was needed, he had come to realise, was not an increased focus on using time efficiently. It was the opposite: more slack.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Thinking about time encourages clockwatching, which has been repeatedly shown to undermine the quality of work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“The best companies I visited, all through the years, were never very hurried,” DeMarco said. “Maybe they used pressure from time to time, as a sort of amusing side-effect. But it was never a constant. Because you don’t get creativity for free. You <em>need</em> people to be able to sit back, put their feet up, and think.” Manual work can be speeded up, at least to a certain extent, by increasing the time pressure on workers. But good ideas do not emerge more rapidly when people feel under the gun – if anything, the good ideas dry up.</p> <p>Part of the problem is simply that thinking about time encourages clockwatching, which has been repeatedly shown in studies to undermine the quality of work. In one representative experiment from 2008, US researchers asked people to complete the Iowa gambling task, a venerable decision-making test that involves selecting playing cards in order to win a modest amount of cash. All participants were given the same time in which to complete the task – but some were told that time would probably be sufficient, while others were warned it would be tight. Contrary to an intuition cherished especially among journalists – that the pressure of deadlines is what forces them to produce high-quality work – the second group performed far less well. The mere awareness of their limited time triggered anxious emotions that got in the way of performance.</p> <p>But worse perils await. DeMarco points out that any increase in efficiency, in an organisation or an individual life, necessitates a trade-off: you get rid of unused expanses of time, but you also get rid of the benefits of that extra time. A visit to your family doctor provides an obvious example. The more efficiently they manage their time, the fuller their schedule will be – and the more likely it is that you will be kept sitting in the waiting room when an earlier appointment overruns. (That’s all a queue is, after all: the cost of someone else’s efficiency, being shouldered by you.) In the accident and emergency department, by contrast, remaining “inefficient” in this sense is a matter of life and death. If there is an exclusive focus on using the staff’s time as efficiently as possible, the result will be a department too busy to accommodate unpredictable arrivals, which are the whole reason it exists.</p> <p>A similar problem afflicts any corporate cost-cutting exercise that focuses on maximising employees’ efficiency: the more of their hours that are put to productive use, the less available they will be to respond, on the spur of the moment, to critical new demands. For that kind of responsiveness, idle time must be built into the system.</p> <p>“An organisation that can accelerate but not change direction is like a car that can speed up but not steer,” DeMarco writes. “In the short run, it makes lots of progress in whatever direction it happened to be going. In the long run, it’s just another road wreck.” He often uses the analogy of those sliding number puzzles, in which you move eight tiles around a nine-tile grid, until all the digits are in order. To use the available space more efficiently, you could always add a ninth tile to the empty square. You just wouldn’t be able to solve the puzzle any more. If that jammed and unsolvable puzzle feels like an appropriate metaphor for your life, it’s hard to see how improving your personal efficiency – trying to force yet more tiles on to the grid – is going to be much help.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>At the very bottom of our anxious urge to manage time better – the urge driving Frederick Winslow Taylor, Merlin Mann, me and perhaps you – it’s not hard to discern a familiar motive: the fear of death. As the philosopher Thomas Nagel has put it, on any meaningful timescale other than human life itself – that of the planet, say, or the cosmos – “we will all be dead any minute”. No wonder we are so drawn to the problem of how to make better use of our days: if we could solve it, we could avoid the feeling, in Seneca’s words, of finding life at an end just when we were getting ready to live. To die with the sense of nothing left undone: it’s nothing less than the promise of immortality by other means.</p> <p>But the modern zeal for personal productivity, rooted in Taylor’s philosophy of efficiency, takes things several significant steps further. If only we could find the right techniques and apply enough self-discipline, it suggests, we could know that we were fitting everything important in, and could feel happy at last. It is up to us – indeed, it is our obligation – to maximise our productivity. This is a convenient ideology from the point of view of those who stand to profit from our working harder, and our increased capacity for consumer spending. But it also functions as a form of psychological avoidance. The more you can convince yourself that you need never make difficult choices – because there will be enough time for everything – the less you will feel obliged to ask yourself whether the life you are choosing is the right one.</p> <p>Personal productivity presents itself as an antidote to busyness when it might better be understood as yet another form of busyness. And as such, it serves the same psychological role that busyness has always served: to keep us sufficiently distracted that we don’t have to ask ourselves potentially terrifying questions about how we are spending our days. “How we labour at our daily work more ardently and thoughtlessly than is necessary to sustain our life because it is even more necessary not to have leisure to stop and think,” wrote Friedrich Nietzsche, in what reads like a foreshadowing of our present circumstances. “Haste is universal because everyone is in flight from himself.”</p> <p>You can seek to impose order on your inbox all you like – but eventually you’ll need to confront the fact that the deluge of messages, and the urge you feel to get them all dealt with, aren’t really about technology. They’re manifestations of larger, more personal dilemmas. Which paths will you pursue, and which will you abandon? Which relationships will you prioritise, during your shockingly limited lifespan, and who will you resign yourself to disappointing? What matters?</p> <p>For Merlin Mann, consciously confronting these questions was a matter of realising that people would always be making more claims on his time – worthy claims, too, for the most part – than it would be possible for him to meet. And that even the best, most efficient system for managing the emails they sent him was never going to provide a solution to that. “Eventually, I realised something,” he told me. “Email is not a technical problem. It’s a people problem. And you can’t fix people.”</p> <p>• <strong>Main illustration: Pete Gamlen</strong></p> <p>• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>',\n",

Reports of similar errors quickly spread on social media, and Uber blamed the mistakes on “human error”, saying the self-driving technology was not at fault and that they would be suspending drivers. </p> <p>That defense earned widespread criticism from transportation experts and safety advocates, who argued that Uber should take responsibility for the actions of its cars and should collaborate with regulators instead of brazenly defying them. </p> <p>One witness said he saw a self-driving Uber run a red light and nearly cause a collision while the vehicle was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/21/witness-says-self-driving-uber-ran-red-light-on-its-own-disputing-ubers-claims\">in self-driving mode</a>. </p> <p>Uber also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/19/uber-self-driving-cars-bike-lanes-safety-san-francisco\">admitted to the Guardian</a> this week that the self-driving technology had a “problem” with bike lanes, raising concerns about serious safety risks in a city where there are an estimated <a href=\"http://www.sfexaminer.com/annual-bike-count-shows-commutes-sf-nearly-9-percent/\">82,000 bike trips</a> each day.</p> <p>The DMV has repeatedly pointed out that 20 manufacturers have gone through proper protocols and obtained permits for self-driving technology. </p> <p>“California’s testing regulations for autonomous vehicles strike a balance between protecting public safety and embracing innovation,” the statement said. “Uber is welcome to test its autonomous technology in California like everybody else.” </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/21/witness-says-self-driving-uber-ran-red-light-on-its-own-disputing-ubers-claims\">Witness says self-driving Uber ran red light on its own, disputing Uber\\'s claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The DMV statement also said it could take less than 72 hours for Uber to get its permits after completing an application: “The department stands ready to assist Uber in obtaining a permit as expeditiously as possible.”</p> <p>Some have suggested that Uber has aggressively tried to avoid permits so that it does not have to face the public scrutiny of a regulatory process. </p> <p>Companies with permits are required to disclose crashes to the government and submit annual “disengagement reports”, which outline situations when a human operator intervened, sometimes due to technology failures. </p> <p>San Francisco’s mayor, Ed Lee, said he supported the removal of the cars in a statement: “I have always been a strong supporter of innovation and autonomous vehicle development and testing, but only under conditions that put human, bicyclist and pedestrian safety first.”</p> <p>John M Simpson, privacy project director for Consumer Watchdog, an advocacy group that has staunchly opposed the pilot program, praised the “DMV’s decisive action”, but said he still had doubts about Uber’s cars and practices.</p> <p>“Given Uber’s safety record over the last two days,” he said, “where they’ve been blasting through red lights and threatening cyclists’ safety, we have fundamental questions about whether the robot cars are even ready to be tested on public highways.”</p>',\n",

The maximum fine in Google’s case is almost $4bn.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bakerlp.com/Google-Blackout-Case/2016-12-19-PAGA-Complaint-Against-Google.pdf\">The lawsuit opens with a strong claim</a>: “Google’s motto is ‘don’t be evil.’ Google’s illegal confidentiality agreements and policies fail this test,” it says.<br /></p> <p>The core of the complaint is that Google’s confidentiality policies prevent employees from exercising speech rights which are protected, both constitutionally and in federal and state law. </p> <p>In a statement given to the Guardian, Google described the suit as “baseless”.</p> <p>“We’re very committed to an open internal culture, which means we frequently share with employees details of product launches and confidential business information”, the company added. “Transparency is a huge part of our culture. Our employee confidentiality requirements are designed to protect proprietary business information, while not preventing employees from disclosing information about terms and conditions of employment, or workplace concerns.”</p> <p>The policies, the lawsuit claims, restrict Googlers from effectively seeking new work, because they cannot use all the skills they gain at the company in future jobs; they unlawfully limit what employees can do out of work, by preventing employees from speaking to the press “or otherwise exercising their speech rights”; and they prevent employees from disclosing information to government or regulators, even if the employee believes that Google is breaking the law.</p> <p>One such policy, cited in the lawsuit, instructs Googlers to “avoid communications that conclude, or appear to conclude, that Google or Googlers are acting ‘illegally’ or ‘negligently,’ have ‘violated the law,’ should or would be ‘liable’ for anything, or otherwise convey legal meaning.” </p> <p>Another training program warns them: “Don’t send an email that says ‘I think we broke the law’ or ‘I think we violated this contract.’” The filing also claims “the training program also advises employees that they should not be candid when speaking with Google’s attorneys about dangerous products or violations of the law.”</p> <p>The suit says that Google’s confidentiality policies go so far that they also “prohibit employees from writing creative fiction. Among other things, Google’s Employee Communication Policy prohibits employees from writing ‘a novel about someone working at a tech company in Silicon Valley’ unless Google gives prior approval to both the book idea and the final draft.”<br /></p> <p>While confidentiality policies are common in Silicon Valley, the suit argues that Google has a responsibility to include in its employee training the fact that staffers are allowed to speak about Google with non-Googlers, even press and regulators, in certain circumstances.</p>',\n",

Another car that had the green light had to “slam the brakes” to avoid a crash, he said.</p> <p>Koff’s story, which advocacy group Consumer Watchdog <a href=\"http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/ltsoublet122016redated.pdf\">shared</a> with state officials on Tuesday, directly contradicts Uber’s public claims that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/14/uber-self-driving-cars-run-red-lights-san-francisco\">red-light violations</a> have been the result of “human error” and that the drivers, not the technology, have failed to follow traffic laws.</p> <p>The new allegations – which Uber denied and which cover an incident three weeks ago – have come to light days after the corporation openly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/16/uber-defies-california-self-driving-cars-san-francisco\">refused to adhere to California regulations</a>, claiming that its defiance of government was an “issue of principle”. </p> <p>Uber’s autonomous cars were first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/self-driving-uber-vehicles-spotted-on-the-streets-of-san-francisco/\">spotted</a> on San Francisco streets in September, but the company formally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/16/uber-defies-california-self-driving-cars-san-francisco\">launched a pilot</a> program to riders last week. California officials have repeatedly said the ride-sharing corporation, which is headquartered in San Francisco, needs testing permits, noting that 20 other companies have followed protocols. </p> <p>But Uber has ignored attorney general Kamala Harris’s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/16/uber-defies-california-self-driving-cars-san-francisco\">threat of legal action</a>, claiming it does not need permits since the vehicles have drivers monitoring and citing the cars’ “state-of-the-art” technology and “core safety capabilities”. </p> <p>Koff’s account, however, suggests that the products may not be ready for the road and that safety mechanisms are insufficient. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/dec/15/uber-self-driving-car-drives-through-red-light-in-san-francisco-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5g6h8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2976974\"            data-video-name=\"Uber self-driving car drives through red light in San Francisco – video\"            data-video-provider=\"Luxor Cab San Francisco\\ufeff\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-585257f7e4b0d14acd717cd7\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/12/15/161215uber_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/12/15/161215uber.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/12/15/161215uber_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/dec/15/uber-self-driving-car-drives-through-red-light-in-san-francisco-video\">Uber self-driving car drives through red light in San Francisco</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It was around 5am local time, and Koff said he was standing 10ft away from the vehicle when he saw it stopped at a light. While the driver was talking to a passenger, who had a laptop out, the car suddenly drove forward into the red, according to Koff. The driver’s hands were not on the wheel, he added.</p> <p>“He was not driving. It was in self-driving mode,” said Koff. He noted that it was foggy at the time and that there were construction trucks nearby shining yellow lights that could have possibly interfered with the technology. </p> <p>It would not be the first time the computer in a self-driving vehicle made a basic error with potentially life-threatening consequences. </p> <p>In May, the “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk\">autopilot sensors</a>” on a Tesla Motors car failed to distinguish a white tractor-trailer crossing the highway against a bright sky, leading to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/02/elon-musk-self-driving-tesla-autopilot-joshua-brown-risks\">first known death caused by a self-driving car</a>. </p> <p>Uber also admitted to the Guardian on Monday that its San Francisco cars have a “problem” with the way they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/19/uber-self-driving-cars-bike-lanes-safety-san-francisco\">cross bike lanes</a>, and the company’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/19/uber-self-driving-pittsburgh-what-drivers-think\">self-driving cars in Pittsburgh</a> have reportedly <a href=\"http://www.wtae.com/article/self-driving-uber-involved-in-collision-downtown/8059178\">collided with other cars</a> and driven the <a href=\"http://qz.com/798092/a-self-driving-uber-car-went-the-wrong-way-on-a-one-way-street-in-pittsburgh/\">wrong way</a> on a street. <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/19/uber-self-driving-pittsburgh-what-drivers-think\">\\'We\\'re just rentals\\': Uber drivers ask where they fit in a self-driving future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler declined to provide details about Koff’s claims and sent the Guardian a statement identical to the one she provided last week, citing “human error”, adding: “This is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building self-driving Ubers.”</p> <p>Kohler did not respond to questions about how the company knows the driver was at fault and whether he faced consequences. Last week, she said two drivers had been suspended after the self-driving vehicles had been recorded running red lights. </p> <p>Critics have argued that regardless of whether violations occur in self-driving mode or while a human is in control, Uber needs to be responsible for dangers posed by its cars – and should be embracing regulators, not shunning them. </p> <p>“Someone could be hurt or maimed or paralyzed for the rest of their life because we’re trying to rush something out there,” said Koff, noting that he also recently saw a driver in an autonomous Uber scramble to take control when it was trying to navigate around a nearby bus and an approaching ambulance. </p> <p>John M Simpson, privacy project director for Consumer Watchdog, who filed a report based on Koff’s incident, said he suspects Uber does not want to follow regulations that would require it to disclose details about errors to the government.</p> <p>“Being able to understand the traffic signal and respond appropriately is a key requirement of any so-called self-driving technology,” said Simpson, who has called for criminal charges against Uber. “It obviously failed that test.”</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>At Christmas – as with any occasion where your whole extended family is crammed into one house amid an abundance of unresolved tensions and alcohol – Monopoly is not always the answer. Similarly, there are times in life when Trivial Pursuit is just going to make everything worse, and when people simply don’t want to hear you explain the rules to Settlers of Catan for the 300th time. Sometimes, only video games will do.</p> <p>So, if at any point during the festive season you find yourself desperate for shared entertainment options (that don’t involve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/dec/14/top-10-group-walks-guided-walking-festivals-uk\">getting out in the fresh air</a>, of course), here is a selection box of local multiplayer titles that will fit the bill. All of them are available for current machines, and most can be downloaded in a couple of hours. This Christmas, don’t become a victim of charades.</p> <p><strong>Minecraft (basically all consoles and computers in existence)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"051e1e1d1fb94f7e4a591394a460e8a8ac865a3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/051e1e1d1fb94f7e4a591394a460e8a8ac865a3c/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A soothing way to while away a few hours.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A soothing way to while away a few hours.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The blocky building sim is the soothing way to while away a few hours with family members, either joining together to create a scale replica of York Minster, or competing in the variety of mini-games available on the PC and now on the console versions. <br /></p> <p><strong>Overcooked (PS4, Xbox One, PC)</strong></p> <p>This frenzied and fun four-player game has you working together in a busy restaurant kitchen supplying increasingly complex dishes to increasingly impatient customers. You really have to work together to fulfil orders, chopping ingredients, mixing them together then washing up afterwards. If nothing else, it’s great practice for the inevitable nightmare of preparing the Christmas dinner with a kitchen full of relatives who don’t know what they’re doing, have drunk too much sherry, and really are going to argue over the best way to stuff a turkey.</p> <p><strong>Lego Dimensions (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U)</strong></p> <p>Boasting a huge range of licensed playsets, the entertaining action-adventure game lets players put real Lego mini-figures and models on a special plinth to control them on screen. But the fun new addition to the game is the Battle Arena mode, which invites up to four players into a series of fights, using any characters they own. Want to see what would happen if Harry Potter faced off against Sonic the Hedgehog? Now you can.</p> <p><strong>Space Team (Android, iOS)</strong></p> <p>Released in 2012, this raucous party game is still one of the best local multiplayer experiences on smartphones and tablets. Up to four people will need to download the game on their iOS or Android devices – they then need to work together to save their space ship – by shouting nonsensical phrases at each other. Each team mate has a different computer display, and will need to listen out if another participant has instructions for them – so your living room essentially becomes the bridge of the USS Enterprise during a scuffle with a Romulan Bird of Prey. What isn’t fun about that?</p> <p><strong>Mario Kart 8 (Wii U)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4047990eedc0e6fc8273f3c1c265b1de6738e3c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4047990eedc0e6fc8273f3c1c265b1de6738e3c8/20_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mario Kart 8: a great place to start your video game racing career\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mario Kart 8: a great place to start your video game racing career</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Any Super Mario Kart title will do to be honest, but the latest title, available on the Wii U, is a great place to start. The set-up is simple: four-players, an array of classic Nintendo characters, superbly designed courses, and the often skill-nullifying presence of power-ups. It’s a recipe for excitement, tension and recrimination, which is what Christmas is all about.</p> <p><strong>Rocket League (PC, PS4, Xbox One)</strong></p> <p>It’s football, but with cars and stunts, and it’s incredibly amusing. That’s all you really need to know about what some see as the greatest multiplayer sports game since Daley Thompson’s Decathlon. </p> <p><strong>Head’s Up (iOS, Android)</strong></p> <p>Endorsed by US television star Ellen DeGeneres, this is a smartphone and tablet version of that classic party game where you scrawl the names of famous people on post-it notes then stick them on your heads and try to guess who is on yours. It’s as fun as it’s always been, but here all the scores and famous people are sorted by your phones, so you have one less thing to squabble over.<br /></p> <p><strong>Towerfall (PC, PS4, Xbox One)</strong></p> <p>A lovely, highly intuitive four-player archery battle, in which players leap around single-screen environments trying to shoot their arrows at everyone else. Lots of scenic traps and power-ups add to the tactical side of the game, as does the fact that your arrows are in short supply and must be retrieved after every shot. Fast-paced and sometimes confusing, but really enjoyable.<br /></p> <p><strong>Rayman Legends (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Wii U, PS3, Xbox 360)</strong></p> <p>Ubisoft’s charming and wonderfully colourful platform adventure can be enjoyed by four players simultaneously, all working together to solve the puzzles and progress through an enchanted forest realm.<br /></p> <p><strong>Fifa 17 or PES 2017 </strong><strong>(PC, PS4, Xbox One)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f5ec21ce257788be4ef0f16e0752c8d08714dd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f5ec21ce257788be4ef0f16e0752c8d08714dd8/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boxing day kickabout?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boxing day kickabout?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Electronic Arts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It doesn’t really matter which title you go for – they both have good and bad points. For the purposes of a basic Boxing day kickabout, you just need either one of these games, four controllers, a big screen and a lot of overly competitive footy fans. Add extra realism to your living room tournament by charging everyone else £80 to watch and then serving them flat beer in plastic glasses for £6 a pint.<br /></p> <p><strong>Just Dance 2017 (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Wii U, PS3, Xbox 360)</strong></p> <p>The latest title in Ubisoft’s well-designed dancing sim series combines modern hits with classic pop songs, and provides dance routines that vary in skill requirements, so everyone can get involved no matter how old, uncoordinated or tipsy. You’ll need the camera peripheral that’s supported by your console, or you can play using a smartphone as the controller.<br /></p> <p><em>Have we missed out your favourite local multiplayer game?

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Anyone who buys a drone in the UK may have to register it and take a safety test under new measures to prevent potential collisions with passenger jets.</p> <p>Measures proposed by ministers also include criminal liability for anyone who flies a drone in “no-fly zones” surrounding airports and prisons, and an increase in fines, which currently cannot exceed £2,500. </p> <p>Ministers also want to make drones electronically identifiable on the ground, in order to make it easier for police to track devices to their owners.</p> <p>The government wants the drone industry – estimated to be worth £102bn by 2025 – to grow safely and with public consent.</p> <p>While there are already strict rules for drone users, the unmanned aerial vehicles, which can operate under remote control or autonomously by onboard computers, have become increasingly widespread, and are cheaply available in high street shops and online.</p> <p>Their popularity has led to a spike in the number of near-misses with passenger jets, with aviation chiefs receiving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/17/drone-came-within-5-metres-of-passenger-jet-at-liverpool-airport\">reports of 56 near-miss incidents</a> in the 10 months to October – up from 29 in all of the previous year and six in 2014.</p> <p>Fears that drones could cause a major air accident were reignited after <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/09/two-near-misses-renew-fears-drones-major-air-accident-manchester-london\">two near-misses</a> this month. In the first incident, investigators said a drone about 2ft (60cm) wide had just missed the right wing of a Boeing 767 coming in to land at Manchester airport. In the second, a drone the size of a football came within 20 metres of an Airbus A320 as it circled above London on its way to Heathrow.</p> <p>The aviation minister, Lord Ahmad, said drones had enormous economic potential and were already being used by emergency services, transport and energy providers and conservation groups to improve services, respond to incidents and save lives.</p> <p>He added, however, that while the vast majority of drone users were law-abiding and had good intentions, “some operators are not aware of the rules or choose to break them, putting public safety, privacy and security at risk”.</p> <p>Current regulations by the Civil Aviation Authority require drones to be kept in line of sight and flown no higher than 120 metres. They also forbid any drone with a camera from flying within 50 metres of buildings, vehicles, people or over large crowds, and anyone using a drone for commercial purposes has to register it with the CAA. But the new plans would mean casual users would also have to register their drones – if they weigh over 250g – and take a test similar to the driving theory test.</p> <p>Tim Johnson, the policy director at the CAA, said: “Our priority is the safe operation of drones and we cannot underestimate the importance of understanding how to use drones safely and responsibly. Drones have significant potential to drive benefits across a range of sectors from farming to emergency response, healthcare to logistics. We encourage anyone with an interest in this area to respond to the government’s consultation.”</p> <p>Steve Landells, flight safety specialist at the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), said: “We need to understand more about the threat drones pose, and Balpa is working with the government and regulators to ensure this is an issue that’s being taken seriously in the corridors of power.</p> <p>“Drones are here to stay and, as this technology develops and becomes more important in the aviation world, it is vital they are integrated into the airspace in a safe and sensible manner.</p> <p>“Pilots are concerned about the growing number of near-misses and the potential for catastrophe should a collision occur.</p> <p>“At the same time, Balpa believes drone operators, especially hobbyists, need to be made aware of the potential dangers of irresponsible flying. We support the Department for Transport in pressing for better education, compulsory registration and high-profile prosecution for careless operators.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>',\n",

This news followed a September revelation of a 2014 incident that allowed hackers to steal the personal data associated with at least 500m Yahoo accounts.</p> <p>Russia was not the only country involved in a hacking controversy in 2016. For the first four months of the year, Apple was in a well-publicized tussle with the FBI over whether the company would help hack into the iPhone of San Bernardino gunman Syed Farook.</p> <p>“2016 was most notable for the evolution of nation state attacks,” said Richard Stiennon, author of There Will Be Cyberwar. “Cyber espionage has been an important tool for hackers and intelligence agencies since at least 2004 and Titan Rain. But releasing the emails from the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta was new and scary.”</p> <p>He also suggested that the lessons for 2017 could begin with looking at who is doing the attacking and then at how much work organizations will have to do in improving data protection.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Releasing the emails from the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta was new and scary</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Stiennon, cyberwar expert</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stiennon said the level of data protection an organization needs to prevent similar breaches and embarrassing “doxing” (wherein stolen documents are released to the public) is daunting to contemplate, but necessary.</p> <p>Craig Fagan, policy director at the World Wide Web Foundation, agrees. “Every citizen has the right to know that their personal data is being stored securely and privately online,” he said. “Yet the scale and breadth of the hacks we’ve seen in 2016 show that governments and companies must do more to safeguard these essential digital rights. 2017 must be the year to change this.”</p> <p>It also looks like the growing scale of attacks will affect how they tackle the threat of hacking in 2017. In the September announcement of its 2016 Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA), the European Police Office (Europol) highlighted the growing range of cyber threats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/16/barack-obama-final-press-conference-election-hacking\">Obama says he warned Russia to \\'cut it out\\' over election hacking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The past year “has seen the further evolution of established cybercrime trends”, according to Steven Wilson, head of Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre. “The threat from ransomware has continued to grow and has now expanded into sectors such as healthcare. Europol has also seen the development of malware targeting the ATM network, impacting cash services worldwide.”</p> <p>Rob Guidry, CEO of social media analytics company Sc2 and a former special adviser to US central command, suggested that money was still a big motive behind many attacks and played a major role in Russian hacking.</p> <p>“Russian hackers, specifically, tend to be motivated by the value of the data that they take. They have also been known to [for compensation] back Russian national strategic pursuits with DDoS and other means, to drive a political aim,” he said. “The Russian government has had a cozy relationship with professional private hackers for years, and it has been highly useful to them.”</p> <p>In addition to being active players in the encouragement of hacking, some governments, the World Wide Web Foundation’s Craig Fagan also warns, are “unravelling the security of the internet for everyone” through new legislation.</p> <p>“For instance, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/19/extreme-surveillance-becomes-uk-law-with-barely-a-whimper\">UK’s new Investigatory Powers Act</a> forces ISPs [internet service providers] to store everyone’s browsing history for 12 months, creating an ideal target for scammers and blackmailers,” he said. “The act is likely to embolden other countries to follow the UK’s bad example, with grave consequences for all of our privacy.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/20/2016-tech-winners-losers-facebook-peter-thiel\">The tech winners and losers of 2016 (hint: Facebook –\\xa0and Facebook)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Andrew Crocker, an attorney on the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s civil liberties team, echoed this sentiment and warned against fear of cyber-attacks and hacking being used by lawmakers to pass sweeping anti-hacking legislation that could have unintended consequences. “The prevalence of these data breaches, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet\">botnets</a>, and other attacks highlight the importance of data security best practices and the need to reject government proposals to weaken security, such as mandating encryption backdoors,” he said.</p> <p>Sc2’s Rob Guidry suggests that by the time we get to the end of 2017, we may look back on the major hacks of 2016 as being not so bad.</p> <p>“It’s going to get worse before it gets better,” he says. “Hacking is going to become a price that people pay for doing business over the internet much in the same way that piracy was once a cost of doing business through shipping.”</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Jan Tian stood in nervous silence in the departure hall of Beijing Capital International Airport. Beside him, his sister held an envelope containing a thousand yuan, close to her entire year’s wages. It was May 1993 and China’s capital was humid, its parks ablaze with tulips, crab apples and red azaleas. But Tian, who had graduated from Beijing University a decade earlier and now worked in Vancouver for the video game company Electronic Arts, had not come to sightsee. The previous week, he had received a phone call to say that his father had suffered a stroke and Tian’s bosses had booked him an emergency flight to China.</p> <p>After a week, the doctors had given their prognosis: Tian’s father would be paralysed down his left side, but would recover. As concern yielded to relief, Tian’s thoughts returned to the work he had left behind in Canada. The release date for EA Soccer, his current project, had recently been brought forward, after an executive walked past an office and heard staff, who were playing an early version of the game, whooping with excitement. For the game to be on shelves by Christmas, it would need to be finished by October. They had less than five months.</p> <p>While Tian and his dozen-or-so colleagues believed fervently in the project, EA’s other executives were less enamoured. “There was great scepticism in the US about the future of soccer,” Trip Hawkins, the computer programmer who had founded EA in 1982, told me. “Nobody cared.” Soccer was still seen by many as a benign distraction for children who showed little talent for American football, the sport on which EA’s early fortunes had been founded.</p> <p>Fifa International Soccer, as the game would eventually be titled, was a modest bet, costing around $30,000 a month to develop. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/23/fifa-16-eight-key-new-features\">Fifa 2016</a>’s development budget, by contrast, is estimated to have been in the region of $350m.) Even so, Tian and his colleagues feared the game might be cancelled at any moment. Speaking to an industry magazine in 2013, Neil Thewarapperuma, then EA Sports’ marketing manager, put it bluntly: “EA didn’t give a shit about Fifa.”</p> <p>The game was broken, too. Before he was called to China, Tian had been wrestling with a knotty programming challenge: how to automatically position players around the pitch in a way that resembled professional football, rather than a playground kickaround where children swarm after the ball. “People may say, what’s so difficult with positioning?” Tian told me recently. “Believe it or not, it’s the most difficult task to program correctly.”</p> <p>While he was at his father’s bedside, a solution – involving “tricky methods and algorithms”, as Tian puts it today – finally came to him. Now, he just needed to find a way to get back to Vancouver quickly, but when he checked, every flight out of Beijing was fully booked.</p> <p>At the airport the next day, a man from the airline approached, wearing a dark blue suit. He took the envelope from Tian’s sister and motioned to the pair to follow him to the ticket office. There, they stood a little distance away, while the man leaned over the counter conspiratorially, and whispered to a colleague. After a moment, Tian was handed a plane ticket. The bribe had worked.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On any Sunday, the day on which it is played most often, more than 200 million Fifa matches take place around the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ten hours later, on a Saturday afternoon, Tian landed in Vancouver. He dropped his bags off at home, washed his face, then drove to the office in a jetlagged fug. The system that Tian implemented over the following weeks to fix the game’s problems with positioning laid the foundations for what would become the world’s most profitable video game franchise.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Along with Mario and Tetris, Fifa belongs to an select group of video games that are familiar to people who have little further interest in the medium. For many, Fifa is the only game they buy each year. In many parts of the world, the word “Fifa” is synonymous not with football’s scandal-ridden governing body, but with the video game that licenses its name.</p> <p>On any given Sunday, the day on which it is played most often, more than 200 million matches of Fifa take place in living rooms, studies and bedrooms around the world. The series has sold more than 150m copies, its popularity extending far beyond the world of football. In 2013, the NBA star LeBron James, who features in numerous EA-made basketball games, posted a photograph to Instagram of his sons playing Fifa alongside the caption: “<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/iMhFmaiTKy/\">Game is fresh to death!</a>” Celebrity endorsements like this on social media can cost more than £10,000 a go. Yet LeBron, alongside other athletes and pop stars (Justin Bieber: “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinbieber/status/382528443323138048\">@Drake: I’m getting nice at Fifa. Be prepared</a>”), have, at least according to EA, expressed their fandom freely.</p> <p>From the start, EA’s long-term ambition – its plan, in fact, for market dominance – was to make a game that faithfully reproduced, pixel by pixel, every aspect of real football. “My vision, even before I founded EA, was to make authentic team-sports-simulation games,” Hawkins told me. EA’s original slogan, repeated in a metallic drawl during the start-up sequences for its sports games, was: “If it’s in the game, it’s in the game.” Later, this became simply: “EA Sports: It’s in the game”.<strong> </strong></p> <p>For most people under the age of 40, that familiarity extends beyond the catchphrase. The pinch of a trigger to make a player sprint, the momentary squeeze to power up a shot, the thumb-flick to perform a defender-beating feint – these moves are almost as deeply embedded in players’ muscle memory as the swipe to unlock their smartphone.</p> <p>EA’s single-minded drive towards authenticity has been key to Fifa’s growing dominance, even at the expense of rival games that videogame critics have considered to be superior. While it is possible to opt to play 90-minute matches, by default Fifa attempts to condense the rhythm and drama of a football match into a more manageable burst of 10 minutes (the in-game clock hurries accordingly). All of the aesthetic pleasures of the real-life game are captured: the feints and step-overs, the curve and dip of a perfectly arced free kick, the rippling net, the boots with the luminous laces. “The entire presentation aims for nothing less than an accurate rendering of the match-day experience, as seen on your TV,” says the video game critic Steve Burns. From the punditry to the branded, whizzing graphics that frame the screen with information before each match, Fifa has evolved to reproduce the glossy sheen of Sky Sports.</p> <p>These trappings are just the start of the game’s campaign for authenticity, which now embraces everything from the rampant commercialism of 21st-century football to the increasingly obsessive focus on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/09/premier-league-football-clubs-computer-analysts-managers-data-winning\">data analytics</a>. Switch on Fifa today and you will be able to play the league or international fixtures of the week, complete with accurate starting line-ups – details that are automatically sucked into the game via the internet. Teams shake hands in front of true-to-life sponsor boards, inside meticulous digital recreations of real-world stadiums, from Wembley to Gamba Osaka’s Suita City. Virtual fans sing their team’s actual chants and spit abuse at the referee – even when he has made the right call. (The virtual ref is programmed to be both omniscient and infallible.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Chelsea’s diminutive attacker Eden Hazard complained that he was \\'three or five centimetres\\' too short in the game</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>EA works with a 9,000-member network of data reviewers, led by the German statistician Michael Müller-Möhring (known as Triple-M by his colleagues) in Cologne. They ensure that each player profile, which includes more than 30 statistics, from speed to stamina to temperament, is as accurate as possible. In the hours after the launch of the latest version of Fifa, which typically arrives each year in the final week of September, many of the 18,000-odd professional footballers included in the game huddle around, anxious to see how their recent form has been translated into the virtual game. The results can sting. In September, the former England and Manchester United player Rio Ferdinand jokingly threatened on Twitter to visit EA’s office and “tear the place down” after his in-game character was<strong> </strong>awarded<strong> </strong>65 out of a maximum of 99 for his passing skills. In 2011, Chelsea’s diminutive attacker Eden Hazard complained that he was “three or five centimetres” too short in the game. This year, the Ipswich midfielder Jonny Williams was upset to find himself described as “injury prone”. “That hurt to be honest,” Williams told the Daily Star. (Such complaints are logged but never acted upon, one current member of the Fifa team told me.)</p> <p>The data Fifa draws upon has become so accurate that teams have started to use the game to scout for potential new signings or to test out the strengths and weaknesses of upcoming opponents. The Arsenal midfielder Alex Iwobi recently told the New York Times that when he was starting out, if a player he had never played against was on the other team, he would “look at his name and then try to remember how good he was on Fifa”. In October 2013, Leyton Orient’s manager introduced a no-Fifa-before-a-match-day policy, after members of his team stayed up late rehearsing the next day’s fixture (which they subsequently lost).</p> <p>The game’s reach is such that its influence has even extended into politics. Last month, communist MPs in Russia complained that a new feature in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/13/fifa-17-new-engine-new-story-mode-and-five-more-key-additions\">Fifa 17</a>, which allows players to dress their virtual team with a rainbow-coloured kit to show support for a campaign against homophobia and transphobia, violated the country’s laws banning so-called “gay propaganda”. If the option was not removed, the MPs suggested, the game could be banned in Russia.</p> <p>Annually updated blockbuster games come with the risk of what publishers refer to as “audience fatigue”, but Fifa’s popularity and influence continues to grow.<strong> </strong>Earlier this year, the German club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/06/wolfsburg-david-bytheway-official-fifa-gamer-football-video-games\">Wolfsburg signed David Bytheway</a>, a 22-year-old from Wolverhampton, as a professional Fifa player. (The club runs competitions in which the prize is to play against Bytheway, pitchside, before a home game.)<strong> </strong>“Our goal is it to create a binding connection between real football and the digital version,” said Klaus Allofs, Wolfsburg’s sporting director, at the time.</p> <p>If EA’s original aim was to fit the whole world of football into Fifa, the company’s dogged pursuit of this goal has come to alter the world of football itself. “Until Fifa is indistinguishable from football in real life and plays exactly like football,” says Matt Prior, Fifa’s current creative director, “we’ll always have more to do.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"af6b68b81504eb72b92ab5ab47828f38ffa664f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af6b68b81504eb72b92ab5ab47828f38ffa664f8/120_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mancester United’s ground, Old Trafford, as realised by Fifa 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mancester United’s ground, Old Trafford, as realised by Fifa 2017</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When Jan Tian emigrated to Canada in 1982, he found a country ravaged by economic depression. “Not even McDonald’s was taking job applications,” he told me. Tian took night classes in computer technology at the British Columbia Institute of Technology, where he learned how to build and program computers. After graduating with honours, he eventually ended up at a local video game developer, which was soon acquired by EA.</p> <p>Tian spent the next three years working on a tennis game, one of EA’s first 3D projects, a vastly challenging undertaking given the limited power of 1980s computers. By the time the game finally came out, he was exhausted. When it failed to sell many copies, he became disillusioned. “I told my managers that I would never again work on a game based on a sport that I don’t actually play in life,” Tian said.</p> <p>In late 1991, after the success of EA’s flagship American football game, John Madden Football, a senior executive named Mark Lewis floated the idea of a soccer equivalent. Lewis, who had been sent to London to set up EA’s European office, wrote a proposal for a lavish, high-tech football game, one to rival the British hits of the time: Sensible Soccer, Championship Manager and Kick-Off.</p> <p>“Almost the entire US organisation was opposed to our idea,” recalls Lewis. “They felt that soccer was too complicated a sport.” Lewis’s tenacity, or perhaps his preposterously ambitious sales predictions – 300,000 units in total throughout Europe – eventually convinced his bosses back in San Francisco. The team began work on a proof-of-concept demo, often the first stage in developing a video game.</p> <p>Lewis was adamant that the game should be made in England – the home, as he saw it, of football. Undaunted by the fact that the British wing of EA was not yet set up for game production, Lewis hired two freelance game designers – Jules Burt and Jon Law – to build the game. The pair, who were based near Liverpool, spent 12 weeks on the prototype, developing three versions of the game, each of which employed a different camera position. The best of the set used a so-called isometric camera angle, positioned as if looking down on the pitch from one of the stadium’s corners. Rather than the top-down view of the pitch that other football games offered, this new perspective captured the players’ entire bodies, closing the distance between video game and televisual representations of the sport.</p> <p>As the British team began to make headway, the senior executives at EA decided to shift development to their more experienced team in Canada, and assigned Tian to the project. When he saw the prototype that Burt and Law had designed, Tian was astonished. “The viewpoint was revolutionary,” Tian told me. And unlike previous football games, where the ball appeared glued to the player’s foot, in Burt and Law’s demo the player knocked the ball forward and had to chase after it. “It felt like real soccer,” says Tian. “I wanted to do exactly that. And I wanted to do it better.”</p> <p>At this stage, Fifa was not called Fifa. When the US office announced its plan to burden the game with the calamitous title Team USA Soccer, Lewis, who was doing his best to steer the production from back in London, immediately began to scrabble for an alternative. (“I spent a lot of time working to keep the US organisation at bay,” Lewis recalls.) In May 1993, while Tian was in Beijing, EA’s vice president of European marketing, Tom Stone, flew to Lucerne in Switzerland to try to broker a deal with international football’s governing body for use of its name. Fifa had the power to give EA the rights to use national teams in the game, and while the organisation was less well known at the time than it is today,<strong> </strong>its imprimatur would lend the game the air of authenticity that EA craved.</p> <p>“The deal was agreed very quickly,” Stone recalls. “We literally licensed four capital letters and we paid a very, very low royalty percentage rate.” Two decades later, Stone still refuses to disclose precise figures, but it is clear that those in charge of Fifa’s licences did not realise the value of their brand. “They were a bunch of old men who had no idea what they had,” Stone said. At EA’s base in California, however, nobody took much notice. “Almost no interest was shown by the Americans,” Stone says. “I mean this respectfully, but the reason Fifa is so successful is that the game was developed and published a long way from head office.”</p> <p>As summer drew on and the deadline approached, Tian’s team began to work 16 hour days. At one point Tian was hospitalised for exhaustion, although he returned to work after just a few days, against doctor’s orders. Late one night in 1993, Tian’s office phone rang. Bruce McMillan, then vice president of EA Canada, picked up.<strong> </strong>“Can you let my daddy come home please?” the voice on the other end of the line said.</p> <p>At 2am one September morning, McMillan, production manager Joey Della-Savia, and Tian sat together at a desk looking over the game. “It’s time, Jan,” McMillan recalls saying. “Leave it alone now.” Della-Savia locked Tian’s keyboard so that he could not make any more changes, and burned a final “master” copy of the game. McMillan took the game home with him, then sat and played it until first light. In the morning he sent a message to the UK office: “It’s time to ship.”</p> <p>Within four weeks of its launch, Fifa International Soccer had almost doubled the UK office’s ambitious sales predictions, selling more than half a million copies to become the best selling game of the year.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>At first, despite EA’s best intentions, Fifa did not look much like real football. For one thing,<strong> </strong>the virtual players were not based on real footballers. David Platt, the England midfielder and Serie A star, featured on the cover of the first edition of Fifa – but that’s where he stayed. Within the game, you could choose from 48 national sides, from Scotland to Saudi Arabia, each of which consisted of 20 players. But every player looked identical, bar varying shades of skin tone, and each one had a fictional name. (Tian’s namesake “Janco Tiano” was a crack striker, naturally.) “It was a compromise,” said Marc Aubanel, a producer on the game. “NHL, NBA and NFL all had player unions and a league with team rights. Soccer in the early 90s was not set up with licensing in mind.”</p> <p>Following the success of the first game, EA jostled to gain the image rights to as many teams, stadiums and players as it could. The following year’s sequel, Fifa Soccer 95 included club sides from across eight different national leagues, including the Premier League. Negotiating these deals hurt EA’s bottom line but were considered an unavoidable cost to maintain an edge over the competition. “What if someone else got Manchester United?” says Aubanel.</p> <p>EA’s interest in licensing awoke in the English FA and Premier League an appreciation for wider commercial opportunities. “I was going to the Football Association, the Premier League, the Professional Footballers’ Association, and none of them knew who owned the rights for player likenesses or stadiums, and so on,” says Stone. “We provided the impetus for the associations to get organised.”</p> <p>By the time of the 1998 World Cup, Fifa had realised the extent to which it had undersold its licence and, when the time came to renegotiate the contract, the price-tag had risen. EA’s staff were forced to negotiate an increasingly complicated web of licences in order to secure the rights to the major teams, players and even commentators such as the BBC’s John Motson and Sky Sports’ Andy Gray, who would come into the studio and ad-lib commentary, without visual prompts.</p> <p>With Fifa’s success, new competitors entered the market each year. Most – even those such as Actua Soccer, a launch title for Sony’s PlayStation in 1995 that employed motion capture to make players’ movements look more realistic, and advanced use of commentary to match the on-screen action – were soon obliterated by EA’s marketing clout, the competitive advantage of the Fifa licence, and the Canadian team’s willingness to adopt, then surpass the competition’s techniques. Fifa’s dominance was, for a while, unchallenged.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7531a846861919ba479d87e6f6fe7a6e2332a036\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7531a846861919ba479d87e6f6fe7a6e2332a036/3_0_1492_895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The real Lionel Messi is filmed for his Fifa avatar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The real Lionel Messi, an avid Fifa player, is filmed on motion capture in order to make his Fifa avatar more realistic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the late 1990s a clear rival emerged in Japan. Konami’s International Superstar Soccer became the choice of the purist, thanks to its focus on fast-paced, tactical play. The choice between Fifa or International Superstar Soccer (later renamed Pro Evolution Soccer, or simply PES, as it is now known) became more than a simple question of personal taste, it spoke to your entire philosophy of video games. Were you someone who valued style over substance? Were you swayed by graphics or gameplay? Fifa was made by an army of anonymous workers. By contrast, PES was driven by a self-proclaimed auteur, Shingo Takatsuka, who went by the nickname “Seabass” (a reference to his love of sea fishing). Fifa had slickness, but PES had soul.</p> <p>As the rivalry intensified, according to a former employee, the absence of any major licensing deal soon became a major problem for Konami. Throughout the 1990s, Konami was forced to refer to Liverpool as the Anfield Reds. For most people, the former employee said, not being able to play as their favourite team is a deal-breaker: “It just makes a game feel budget and unofficial, regardless of whether it’s technically the better game.” EA built its strategy to dominate the football market on this simple fact. “We knew that games were on their way to becoming photorealistic,” Aubanel told me, “The more realistic the game is, the more you notice a lack of likeness rights.”</p> <p>“There seemed to be no real inclination across the stakeholders at Konami to do anything about EA’s clear plans to grow Fifa,” the former Konami employee told me. “Meanwhile, EA seemed to become obsessed with destroying PES.” A rumour went around Konami’s UK offices that EA had a graph of Fifa’s year-on-year sales numbers versus the declining PES sales, displayed in its reception area. Whether or not such a graph existed – a spokeswoman for EA told me she has no recollection of it – employees at Konami began to feel as if they were under siege. “As ghoulish as that sounds, when a company of that size focuses on a singular objective like that,” said the ex-employee, “it’s an incredibly tough thing to fight against.”</p> <p>Through the first decade of the millennium, PES retained its identity as the superior underdog. (One reviewer wrote of Fifa 06: Road To Fifa World Cup, “It’s not only awful, but it’s also sabotaging everybody else’s efforts at the same time.”) According to the video game critic Steve Burns: “Over the years, Fifa’s need for ‘realism’ bled into the on-pitch action and harmed the game.” Those meticulously motion-captured player animations, which include every stretch and flex of a digital muscle, Burns argues, slow the game’s pace.</p> <p>Konami’s game, by contrast, is less concerned with realism than what Burns describes as “feel”. “I once asked a senior PES developer why it feels so much better to score a goal in PES than Fifa,” Burns said. “He told me that the shooting animations are deliberately not accurate recreations of the real thing. They leave room for player intuition and invention.” Counterintuitively, Burns believes that, by employing brisker, more cartoonish animations whenever a digital player, say, leaps for a header or executes a showboating overhead kick, PES better replicates what we imagine it <em>feels like</em> to be a hyper-athletic professional footballer, rather than the exact reality.</p> <p>Over time, though, Fifa continued to pull ahead commercially. By Fifa 07, EA owned the rights to more than 500 teams, in 27 leagues, with more than 10,000 players. The football world was almost fully contained within the game. In 2012, EA dealt a particularly painful blow to its Japanese rival when it stole PES’s cover star, Lionel Messi. (Messi was, reportedly, always a Fifa man anyway; Victor Vázquez, a former teammate in Barcelona’s youth academy, remembered Messi often playing the game “for three hours without a break”.)</p> <p>Fifa has established a daunting lead over its old rival. According to sales figures leaked in October, Fifa 17 sold 40 times more copies than Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 in the week following each game’s release. “We will never underestimate EA and the talented Fifa team, but our goal is to establish PES as the definitive football title,” Adam Bhatti, PES’s defiant brand manager recently said.</p> <p>As video games have, in the past decade, become ever more expensive propositions – costs often exceed £100m – so the risks have escalated. Ryan Payton, an American game designer who worked at Konami, recalls being shown around the Pro Evolution Soccer team’s office on his first day at the Tokyo-based studio in 2005. “I was told: ‘This is the project that brings in the money. If anything bad happens to this team, we will be in deep trouble,’” Payton said. Today, Konami produces few video games and, instead, focuses on Japanese pachinko gambling machines and health spas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bffb3b878c145f3101eab0e07ca7f9e274234897\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bffb3b878c145f3101eab0e07ca7f9e274234897/42_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pro Evolution Soccer 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fifa’s main rival Pro Evolution Soccer, which is made by Konami.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>These days, Fifa is produced by a core team of roughly 100 people working in EA’s 400,000 square foot campus in the Vancouver suburbs. Although EA makes other games here, Fifa is the site’s flagship project (a three-quarter-length football pitch sits at the centre of the campus grounds). In the early days, the game was essentially the product of “a few people in their basements”, says creative director Matt Prior, who first played Fifa with his friends while growing up in Manchester in the mid-90s. “Now it’s a blockbuster-film-sized army.”</p> <p>As well as the usual phalanxes of programming machines, the EA campus also contains a warren of video editing suites, music composition rooms and a 130 foot-long motion-capture studio, where footballers such as Gareth Bale and Sergio Agüero are tracked as they run, kick and tumble, in order to translate their movements into the game. EA also takes its head-scanning rig on the road, photographing around 500 new players every year from various angles so that their digital versions appear as true-to-life as possible.</p> <p>For professional footballers, lending one’s likeness to the game has become far more than just another source of easy income. For Fifa: Road to World Cup 98,<strong> </strong>David Beckham appeared on the cover. “There is no doubt that was a piece in the puzzle that led Beckham to be the most marketable footballer on the planet,” Andy Bell, founder of Soap Box London, a company that manages sports personalities such as Watford striker and captain Troy Deeney, told the Sun in 2015. “The paradigm has shifted,” Matt McKie, the global brand director for EA Sports’ Fifa franchise, told me. “If someone signs a marketing deal with Fifa they get much more than a cheque; it’s not like endorsing a car.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some players, such as Mats Hummels, have even incorporated techniques learned on the virtual pitch into their game</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some players have even incorporated techniques learned on the virtual pitch into their real-life game. The German defender Mats Hummels once alluded to the way in which Fifa can help players visualise new ways of playing, saying “some people use what they learn in Fifa when they find themselves on the pitch”. In 2008, after saving a penalty from AC Milan’s Ronaldinho, the Italian goalkeeper Marco Amelia said: “It was just like playing against him on PlayStation – he had the same run-up. It was very strange.”</p> <p>As EA continues its quest for greater and greater realism, Matt Prior’s eagerness to make Fifa “indistinguishable” from real-world football may seem like a logical, if distant, objective. But to those who follow the game closely, it is something of a mirage. Most years, Fifa swings between a more simulation-based approach – with keenly realistic physics that generally allow for fewer goals – and a more impressionistic, playful take, in which it is easier to score screamers from 30 yards, and matches can finish with double-digit scores. Each direction has its supporters and detractors. “That’s the eternal balancing act,” says Prior. “Some people like it sim-based and defensive. Others want to jump in and see huge scorelines. There’s no perfect answer.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/24/the-beautiful-game-20-how-fifa-17-taught-real-football-a-lesson\">The beautiful game 2.0: how Fifa 17 taught real football a lesson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Any changes to the game tend to arouse fierce passions. In 2013, at E3, one of the video game industry’s largest annual conferences, held in Los Angeles, I remember the whoops of delight when an EA spokesperson announced that the players in that year’s Fifa would be able to turn their necks to head the ball at greater than 90 degrees in each direction – something that had, he said, “never before been possible”.</p> <p>To the outsider, it is incomprehensible that these arcane particulars could elicit such strong reactions. Yet David Rutter, the game’s executive producer, routinely receives death threats via social media from fans maddened by some perceived misstep in the game’s design. On one forum dedicated to the series, there are more than 2,000 threads<strong> </strong>that contain the word “rant” in the title. “Fans of Fifa are some of the most passionate people in the world,” Rutter told me, diplomatically.</p> <p>Much of the consternation revolves around one recent addition to the series, Fifa Ultimate Team (FUT). In this mode, you form a squad from a random selection of Panini-style playing cards, which include players from the past and present, then compete with your ragtag band of players online. Wins are rewarded with new packs of cards. You must pay, however, to enter each tournament, either using virtual funds accumulated in other modes, or actual money (around £2.50 for each entry to a tournament). Many players see FUT as exploiting the goodwill of fans. “I have spent the best part of £100 on packs and got completely nothing,” wrote one player. At a Morgan Stanley investor conference held in 2016, EA’s chief financial officer Blake Jorgensen revealed that the company makes $650m a year from the sale of virtual packs alone.</p> <p>Fifa can wheedle its way into life in unexpected ways. Not long ago, my seven-year-old son was playing a friendly match as Sunderland. With an unassailable lead against the computer, he decided to give his opponent a boost by attempting to score an own goal. As my son approached his six-yard box, his team’s computer-controlled goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford, launched a savage tackle that sent his teammate spinning through the air. The goalkeeper was given a red card and in that moment, a vendetta began. “Pickford” has since become a percussive curse word in our household. My son routinely plays as Sunderland just to send Pickford, in the first minutes of a match, mournfully, to the subs bench. He runs Pickford recklessly up the pitch, praying for a leg-shattering injury. From Fifa, he has learned an appreciation not only for the beauty of this most beautiful sport, but also its agony, its ecstasy and, in the hated form of Jordan Pickford, a football fan’s ability to hold an everlasting grudge.</p> <p>For many who have worked on Fifa over the years, its success has come at a cost. “I paid for it with my health and family life,” Tian told me. EA’s demands on staff have escalated in recent years. When many major video game publishers only release two or three games a year, survival is dependent on each one being a hit. For Prior, managing “crunch”, as the hectic weeks of overwork leading up to a video game’s launch are grimly referred to within the industry, is another priority. “The work-life balance is way, way better than it was when I first started,” he says.</p> <p>EA’s current licence agreement with Fifa only runs for five more years. When the next negotiations arrive, football’s governing body can surely name its price, knowing that the game’s brand recognition depends on those four, monolithic letters. But if the price is too high, EA may choose not to renew its agreement. Perhaps Fifa could thrive without Fifa, after all. It is no stretch to argue that, just as the game has transcended the governing body from which it takes its name, so, to many, it has become, not an adjunct to, but a vital component of the sport on which it is based.</p> <p>In 2014 an ESPN poll found that 34% of Americans became soccer fans as a result of playing the game, while half of all Americans say that the game has increased their interest in the sport. Once upon a time, children would become football fans through Match of the Day, Panini cards jammed in tatty sticker books, and pull-out posters of Glenn Hoddle or Pelé. That has all changed. “Nowadays,” says Prior, “people come to football through our game.”</p> <p>• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>',\n",

Jarvis, who is voiced in the video by Morgan Freeman, is the virtual assistant the Facebook CEO set out to build as a personal challenge that would help him understand the state of artificial intelligence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/12/facebook-2016-problems-fake-news-censorship\">2016: the year Facebook became the bad guy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As we sweep through Zuckerberg’s enormous, minimalist home, we witness Jarvis provide calendar briefings, entertain Zuck’s daughter Max in Mandarin, identify and let people into his home, control the lights and play music. There are smiles and tickles and popcorn interspersed with on-brand messaging about Messenger bots, internet drones and conference calls. It’s a two-minute, unsolicited humblebrag with a hammy script and a stilted, dead-eyed delivery that makes you question whether Mark or Jarvis is the robot. (At one point he eats an unbuttered piece of toast straight from the toaster. What kind of human does this?)</p> <p>In releasing this video, Mark Zuckerberg has become Jenny from high school who sends professionally shot holiday cards featuring her husband Chip and their two adorable children all wearing Santa hats and holding large carved oak letters that spell out “blessed”. </p> <p>Inside, there’s a round-robin newsletter: “Chloe is showing a real affinity for ballet (more good toes than naughty toes!) while Tucker is reading well above grade level – who knew eight-year-olds would enjoy Dostoevsky?!” By meticulously choreographing a pastiche of domestic bliss and quirky invention, Zuck’s “people” appear to be trying to shift the attention away from 2016’s tribulations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mark Zuckerberg has become Jenny from high school who sends professionally shot holiday cards featuring her husband Chip</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is Zuckerberg the tinkerer and family man, not the guy accused of building algorithms that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-fake-news-election-conspiracy-theories\">played a role in the US presidential election</a>. Unfortunately, the performance is as wooden as Jenny’s letters.</p> <p>Then there are the jokes, which we should probably call “fake jokes”. They look like jokes and are delivered like jokes, but they are devoid of real joke content. The Guardian understands that some of these so-called “jokes” were produced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/facebook-clickbait-political-news-sites-us-election-trump\">entrepreneurial Macedonian teenagers</a>. At one point Mark asks Jarvis to “play us some good Nickelback songs” and Jarvis responds: “I’m sorry, Mark, I’m afraid I can’t do that.” Ooh, we think, a 2001: A Space Odyssey reference. Perhaps Jarvis has turned evil?

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>After the disappointment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/31/miitomo-first-look-review-nintendo-mobile-app-any-good\">Miitomo</a>, Nintendo has once again ventured into the world of smartphone gaming with Super Mario Run. </p> <p>Following on from the success of the release of Pokémon Go in the summer, the anticipation from fans craving the nostalgia of classic Nintendo games has come to an end. But with <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/article/25374-super-mario-run-nintendo-mobile-game-pricing\">some unhappy about the price of the iOS exclusive app</a> we asked readers what they really think of the game.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"602d0bef98259fd2a8e6399713dcb9693e18e993\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/602d0bef98259fd2a8e6399713dcb9693e18e993/300_167_177_221/177.png\" alt=\"Jonathan Chadwick from Sydney\" width=\"177\" height=\"221\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>‘Hardcore gamers might prefer to stick to their console versions’<br /></h2> <p>Rating: 3.5 out of 5 </p> <p>The inability to run backwards is often quite frustrating. With previous Super Mario games it’s fun to explore each level to make sure you’ve covered all ground. Because Mario is running forward continuously, it feels like you’re running past hidden features. I think it’s more a game for the busy commuter who likes to pass the time by fiddling with their iPhone. It only really requires half your attention; I feel as though Nintendo deliberately tapped into that market to get people who don’t normally play games to download the app. But you can’t help but question how much you’re really ‘playing’ the game when you’re merely tapping the screen. <br /></p> <p>You can actually leave Mario up to his own devices for a while and he’ll do his own thing. It would be the perfect game for zombies. Apart from that the look of the game is awesome. It’s very sleek and shiny and looks especially good on an iPad Air screen, much better than Super Mario on the 3DS. I think it’s great that they’re developing games as an app; you can basically choose your own hardware now. <br /></p> <p>I can’t believe people are upset that they’ve had to pay 8 quid to then discover they don’t like it, especially considering they get the first three levels for free. Because it’s an app they feel they are entitled to it for nothing. My advice is, if you don’t think you can face the disappointment of not liking it, don’t buy it. Hardcore gamers might prefer to stick to their console versions. <br /></p> <p><em>Jonathan Chadwick, Sydney</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"66ef5ef078d2ded567f09ade91523fb4db5749c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66ef5ef078d2ded567f09ade91523fb4db5749c4/40_0_215_269/215.jpg\" alt=\"Zia Murad from Dubai\" width=\"215\" height=\"269\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>‘Slick, charming, and well-produced’<br /></h2> <p>Rating: 3.5 out of 5 </p> <p>Nintendo have a long, celebrated history of creating and perfecting platform games, so it comes as no surprise that Super Mario Run has the tight mechanics and precision-based jumping that we’ve come to expect from the world’s most famous gaming mascot. <br /></p> <p>At a price of £7.99, they have exceeded what the casual mobile gamer is willing to pay for on-the-go entertainment. Additionally, it’s only playable with an internet connection, which seems like a ludicrous caveat when you’ve already paid almost £8. <br /></p> <p>The game itself is a slick, charming, and well-produced endless runner that is playable with one hand. The level-design is fantastic; each of the 24 stages has been crafted to be re-playable with harder difficulties in the shape of collectible coloured coins. I happily repeated the same levels several times, trying to figure out the exact route I needed to take, and when executed correctly it felt very rewarding. Super Mario Run is a polished, meticulously designed, and ultimately fun mobile title that does more than just appeal to nostalgia. However, it comes at a price that many casual gamers will find hard to justify. </p> <p><em>Zia Murad, Dubai</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"796208b0f876bba833c80ba3bba84e97469d5cfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/796208b0f876bba833c80ba3bba84e97469d5cfd/101_0_504_630/400.jpg\" alt=\"M, Hong Kong\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>‘I finished all the levels in one day which I think is a bit fast’<br /></h2> <p>Rating: 4 out of 5 </p> <p>I think the one hand operation is good. Most people dislike that Mario moves automatically, but I think this makes the game more challenging - like getting pink coins or grey coins. Most people just play the first three levels and stop, but I think the game just gets started from that point! I finished all the levels in one day which I think is a bit fast =( <br /></p> <p>For 9.99 the price is a bit high. It would be great if it was a free game but a one time payment is fine. It would be better if there was more of a social aspect, mini game option, or even the ability to battle with friends. <br /></p> <p><em>M, Hong Kong</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"60074702dd1d24c9a52652ec967c2d64f42c01ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60074702dd1d24c9a52652ec967c2d64f42c01ac/103_249_821_1026/800.jpg\" alt=\"John Price from Plymouth\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>‘My favourite thing about the game is they let me pay for it’<br /></h2> <p>Rating: 4.5 out of 5 </p> <p>Nintendo has built a Mario game that feels like a Mario game, but is not hampered by the limits of a mobile. Mario looks like Mario, sounds like Mario, and most importantly for a Mario game jumps like Mario. Unlike an endless runner the stages are handcrafted, built to provide a modest challenge with precise positioning of coins, blocks, and enemies. The challenge of collecting five specific coloured coins drives you to retry each stage multiple times, and when you succeed, the five coins will be placed elsewhere. <br /></p> <p>It’s a great game for a quick dip in and out of. A run takes mere moments which is perfect. It handles wonderfully, one thumb touch which does everything you want it to do. The design choice of having a chunk of unused space at the bottom of the screen means that unlike most mobile games I never feel like my touching the screen gets in the way of seeing the action. But my favourite thing about Super Mario Run: they let me pay for it. A one off payment unlocks everything I need. There is nothing pushing me to drop more money to buy new lives, or buy gems which are needed to purchase levels or anything like that. A one off £8 payment for a quality game single handedly solves every problem I’ve had with other mobile games. I look forward to completing it during the excessive loading times when fast travelling in Final Fantasy XV. <br /></p> <p><em>John Price, Plymouth</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"33243b690c2fb47c95c1ef5e9a596027b452c88f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33243b690c2fb47c95c1ef5e9a596027b452c88f/69_117_820_1025/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sullivan from Brooklyn\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sullivan, Brooklyn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>‘Terrible marketing’<br /></h2> <p>Rating: 2.5 out of 5 </p> <p>Paying 10 bucks after a few levels is terrible marketing. I’m not sure if they’ve checked out popular games but the money comes in the items not the actual gameplay. If I have to pay 99 cents for a special move, fine, but I shouldn’t have to pay money to play the next level. </p> <p><em>Sullivan, Brooklyn</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"48b3045b8ad1cb675619f910b46234fd91560944\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48b3045b8ad1cb675619f910b46234fd91560944/265_151_613_767/400.jpg\" alt=\"Dani Thomas from Cardiff\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>‘A crafted product with depth and replay value’<br /></h2> <p>Rating: 4.5 out of 5 </p> <p>I can’t get my head around the negative reaction to this game. Its easily worth £7.99 in my opinion. You play the first three levels, then decide if you want to pay - seems perfectly reasonable to me. I don’t know why so many people expected to play the whole game for free. <br /></p> <p>This isn’t your average iOS shovel-ware - it’s a crafted product with depth and replay value. On one hand it concerns me that people don’t seem to be able to tell the difference - on the other, I suppose this is an inherent risk when aiming a product at the mass market. Yesterday, I spent £6.50 for two coffees and a slice of shortcake, and £7.99 for Super Mario Run. I know which purchase I think was better value.<em><br /></em></p> <p><em>Dani Thomas, Cardiff</em><em><br /></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"911555f2fa6c740b0cdced370b3136cfe0adef08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/911555f2fa6c740b0cdced370b3136cfe0adef08/0_193_720_900/400.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Johnson from Manchester\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>‘Mario for the modern world’<br /></h2> <p>Rating: 5 out of 5 </p> <p>Super Mario Run is a seemingly simple, yet deceptively complex mobile version of a gaming legend. The auto-run-forward of the portly plumber detracts nothing from the side scrolling platform action, instead allowing more attention to be paid to the at times frustrating pixel perfect jump. Speaking of pixels, the graphics are detailed and hi-res enough to satisfy modern eyes. <br /></p> <p>The Nintendo charm is ever present throughout and fans of Mario will be pleased with the look and tone of the package. Yes, the package. People bemoaned the £7.99 charge upon reaching the first Koopa confrontation. However, in my opinion there is enough to satisfy. Six worlds, three levels and a boss battle in each. There’s also a road rally which shifts the emphasis of the platforming action to style over course completion and enemy squashing. This leads to village building and toad pleasing mini games. There’s more than enough here to justify eight quid and it’s a few notches above other mobile gaming fare as well, as like it or lump it, Nintendo are still masters of the video game. This is Mario for the modern world. Quick bursts on the loo, on the tram/train/bus, while you wait for your wife to look through the whole shop and for some, while they walk around narrowly avoiding lampposts. Buy it. Enjoy it. </p> <p><em>Tony Johnson, Manchester</em></p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>The European commission (EC) has filed charges against Facebook for providing “misleading” information in the run-up to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/19/facebook-buys-whatsapp-16bn-deal\">social network’s acquisition of messaging service WhatsApp</a> after its data-sharing change in August.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The charges will not have an affect on the approval of the $22bn merger and is being treated completely separately to other European cases against Facebook, but could lead to Facebook being fined up to 1% of its global turnover in 2014 when the merger was approved, which was greater than $10bn for the first time.</p> <p>The European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said: “Companies are obliged to give the commission accurate information during merger investigations. They must take this obligation seriously.</p> <p>“Our timely and effective review of mergers depends on the accuracy of the information provided by the companies involved. In this specific case, the commission’s preliminary view is that Facebook gave us incorrect or misleading information during the investigation into its acquisition of WhatsApp. Facebook now has the opportunity to respond.”</p> <p>The commission said that Facebook informed regulators that it would not be able to perform automated matching between user-held Facebook accounts and WhatsApp accounts. However, Facebook’s privacy policy change for WhatsApp in August, for which the EC was notified in January, specifically enabled automated matching and data sharing after technical changes, including one for Apple and its iOS, allowed the matching of the majority of accounts not using a phone number with Facebook.</p> <p>The commission’s review of the merger in 2014 revolved around whether Facebook would or could merge the two messaging services, making them cross-compatible; a technically difficult feat that was made harder in 2016 with the roll out of WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption for messages by default.</p> <p>Facebook has until 31 January 2017 to respond to the charges.</p> <p>A Facebook spokesperson said the company was pleased that the EC stands by its clearance of the company’s WhatsApp acquisition and would continue to co-operate with regulators to resolve their complaints. It said: “We respect the commission’s process and are confident that a full review of the facts will confirm Facebook has acted in good faith.</p> <p>“We’ve consistently provided accurate information about our technical capabilities and plans, including in submissions about the WhatsApp acquisition and in voluntary briefings before WhatsApp’s privacy policy update this year.”</p> <p>Facebook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/17/facebook-halts-use-of-whatsapp-data-for-advertising-in-europe\">halted the use of user data</a> shared between WhatsApp and Facebook for advertising purposes in November after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/whatsapp-pause-sharing-user-data-facebook-european-privacy-regulators-yahoo\">pressure from the pan-European data protection agency group</a> Article 29 Working Party in October.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/whatsapp-access-personal-information-privacy-facebook-consumers-information-commission\"><strong>Why we should worry about WhatsApp accessing our personal information - Elizabeth Denham</strong></a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/eu-multinationals-tax-arrangements-us-google-amazon\"><strong>EU proposals will force multinationals to disclose tax arrangements</strong></a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/facebook-wins-appeal-against-belgian-privacy-watchdog-over-tracking\"><strong>Facebook wins appeal against Belgian privacy watchdog over tracking</strong></a></li> </ul>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>The very first thing I saw in virtual reality was Wevr’s theBlu demo, back in the early days of the HTC Vive headset. It’s the thing a lot of people mention when they’re asked about the most compelling VR experiences, and with good reason: the demo transports you to the helm of a sunken ship, the whole ocean above your head; it allows you to take in the beauty of the scene for a few minutes before, out of the depths, a vast blue whale slowly emerges, dwarfing you. </p> <p>I took the headset off and walked away across the busy floor of the game conference, but I could still feel the water around me. I told my friends. They joined the long queues. They told their friends. And that was the entire story that was told: there is a whale and it is beautiful. Since then, I’ve flown spaceships and climbed buildings and repaired robots in VR. I’ve shot a variety of floating objects. I’ve sat cross-legged in the middle of Venice’s Piazza San Marco and looked down on the people in the flooded square. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFKbL-GU-_U\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MFKbL-GU-_U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>But here’s what I haven’t done. I have never met a single original, memorable character in virtual space. I have never interacted in a conversation. I cannot recall a single line of dialogue. When I bring this up with Jason Rubin, head of content at Oculus, the company behind the Rift headset that kickstarted the modern VR revolution, the reason becomes clear: storytelling – actual storytelling – is very, very difficult with this technology. </p> <p>Rubin is no newcomer to narrative games. The co-founder of Naughty Dog (Uncharted, The Last of Us) and former president of THQ, he has a history of design, production and storytelling across a vast swath of best-selling titles. Originally joining Oculus in 2014 as their head of worldwide studios, Rubin was promoted to head of content this year, where he essentially acts as a high level producer for all of Oculus’s VR development. If there are to be stories on this platform, it’s his job to facilitate them.</p> <p>Rubin closes his eyes and tips his head back. “The first story that I saw in VR would have probably been <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1016967501697367/\">Lost</a>, from Oculus Story Studios, and I was sitting on the ground,” he says. “I laid down on my back, because most stories I’d seen up until that time gave you a fixed camera – they told you where to look. But Lost has a 360 camera, the world is all around, so the first thing you want to do is look behind you. What you see is forest, and more forest. And so … I started standing up.” </p> <p>When Jason Rubin talks about VR, he can’t sit still. During our conversation he scrutinises a soda can held an inch from his face, he spins in slow circles in his chair, he moves his hands in front of him exaggeratedly to demonstrate ways to use Oculus’s new Touch controllers. Partly this is the result of his animated personality, but it’s also an illustration of the importance Rubin places on physicality in his medium. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41b3e760de9e01d2c438d7207c7b6c73e3dd8f61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41b3e760de9e01d2c438d7207c7b6c73e3dd8f61/25_0_900_540/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Lost demo is a short cinematic experience which puts the player in a forest with a giant robot\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lost demo is a short cinematic experience which puts the player in a forest with a giant robot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oculus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later, I play Lost on a demo station in the middle of Facebook’s London office. It certainly doesn’t feel appropriate to lie down. The first thing I do, after my eyes adjust, is look up at the sky and there is a bright moon up and to my right, framed by tall pine trees. There are ferns. A firefly lazily bobs in front of me. “It’s alive,” says Rubin. “It reacts to you being there.” The thought is so enticing that I instinctively move my hand towards the insect – but there is no representation of my body in this world. Lost predates the touch controllers and Oculus’s new focus on tactility, and so the firefly zips away. </p> <p>It’s an interesting moment, but it’s not a story. It’s interesting that when Rubin describes Lost, he talks about immersion, but never any sort of plot. He doesn’t even mention the gigantic, lamp-eyed robot that, at one point in the demo, leans down through the trees and rumbles “Hello” at you. He doesn’t mention the disembodied hand of the robot, about the size of a horse, crashing through the undergrowth. In a standard game that would be a major talking point, a key encounter, but here, it cannot compete with the sensation of existing in a place, under a wide sky. “Put me on the top of Everest,” Rubin says later, “and I can sit there for 15, 20 minutes and just look around at the beauty. But –” and there’s a note of frustration in his voice, “there’s no story there.” </p> <p>He’s right. </p> <p>This isn’t to say that Oculus hasn’t begun to dip its toe into VR storytelling. Later, I’m shown <a href=\"https://storystudio.oculus.com/en-us/henry/\">Henry</a>, a 10-minute experience by Oculus Story Studio that put me in the brightly coloured treehouse of a small hedgehog who is having a bad birthday. While watching the hedgehog walk around me in 3D was charming and the experience was polished, it felt like it was seriously missing something. Just as I found with the firefly, I was unable to touch or interact with anything. The story played independently of my intentions. It existed around me but my hands were tied.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/134754691\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/134754691\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Earlier in the day, I had been shown <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1217155751659625/\">First Contact</a>, an unbelievably polished demonstration of Oculus’s new Touch controllers. Under the guidance of a big-eyed, Pixar style robot, I feed floppy discs into a 3D printer that creates increasingly outlandish tactile toys. I sweep colourful trails through the air. At one point, I have to keep very still, and a purple butterfly drifts down and perches on the tip of my index finger. </p> <p>When Rubin talks about the potential of Touch, he speaks more generally about play rather than narrative. He brings up Toybox, a game where “There is no game, there is no score, there’s no win or lose state … but there are blocks in front of us.” His hands folding naturally into the shape of the controllers as he demonstrates. “If I throw the block and you catch it … [get] your virtual hand under it and grab … and then we say ‘how many times can we catch this before we drop it’, you’ve just created a game.”</p> <p>I am reminded suddenly of the way Half Life 2 turned the act of throwing a can into a tiny narrative punchline, way back in 2004. Valve realised that the Gravity Gun could be just as useful for playing a quick game of basketball with a robot dog as it was for hurling energy at soldiers, and I can’t help but wonder if we’ll see similar moments appearing in VR. Will improvised games bring us closer to fictional characters? </p> <p>First Contact’s 3D printer gave me a gun. “Shoot the robot!” said the demonstrator. I did not want to shoot the robot, but he pressed me, so I did. A harmless suction dart slapped on to its forehead. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18b277a7bbf8951bf87f7549eb892ec7d19cbab5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18b277a7bbf8951bf87f7549eb892ec7d19cbab5/121_0_1220_732/1000.png\" alt=\"First Contact is a short demo designed to help Rift users learn how to use the Touch controllers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">First Contact is a short demo designed to help Rift users learn how to use the Touch controllers</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oculus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At one point, curious about what would happen, I tried to lean my head forwards through a table. The problem, it turns out, with giving players interactivity in VR stories, is that they take it as a golden opportunity to go completely off piste. </p> <p>“How do you tell a story when the player’s got their head under the table?” I ask Rubin. He pauses. “We are really early when it comes to VR storytelling,” he says, “I don’t think we fundamentally understand the ruleset. </p> <p>“When the first video cameras came out, it took a long time to get a current language that we use in films and we all take for granted,” he says. He talks me through the invention of the “over the shoulder shot”, the standardised method for shooting conversation. “We don’t even notice it’s happening in film [anymore]. That took a while.” </p> <p>Rubin moves through a list of reasons why that simple shot doesn’t work in VR, with the air of somebody who has clearly identified a problem but is unsure of the solution. “If you put a camera over someone’s shoulder, you’re like: ‘It’s discombobulating to be jumping back and forth between two people and reversing my view’. Additionally I may be looking [in the over the shoulder position] and I notice how huge someone’s ear is, which you never really notice in film.” </p> <p>The more I think about presentation of even the most basic conversation, more difficulties emerge. How does the player enter or leave a conversation in VR space? Games like Mass Effect employ a cut or a fade through black, both of which are fairly jarring in virtual reality. Is the player a participant in the conversation? If so, how do they interact with the dialogue systems in a way that doesn’t compromise immersion? If not, do the participants acknowledge their presence? </p> <p>Do the participants make eye contact with the player? Do they know where you’re looking? Do they care? The tactics that standard video games have developed to simulate human interactions are useless here.</p> <p>“Right now,” says Rubin, “each one of these problems exists before you even get to the question of what story should be told.”</p> <p>At no point, however, do I get the feeling that Rubin is simply throwing his hands up in the air and admitting defeat. Each frank concern with the practicality of VR storytelling is countered by some new description of an issue Oculus has overcome: how 3D cursors need to be drawn in scenes to allow players to accurately follow objects, how to track the player’s gaze to control narrative timing. </p> <p>I ask him if there are developers who are getting close to cracking the other problems we’ve discussed. The whole over-arching problem of creating something that isn’t just an immersive environment, but also a world in which a cogent story takes place. “There is a submission,” he says carefully, “which is currently sitting in the office and has not yet been run, because we’re missing a file.” I am caught by how unexpectedly evocative the situation seems. “This is a first attempt at something that Oculus has funded as a storytelling device.” </p> <p>He is deliberately cagey, and it’s clear this is partly because he hasn’t played it. There is an air, though, of Rubin as a stage magician drawing the audience’s attention towards a disk on a desk. I cannot help but wonder what problems it could be trying to solve, and my mind goes back to our chat about the complexities of depicting conversation, and the pioneers who first moved the camera over somebody’s shoulder.</p> <p>“It has a plot,” says Rubin. “It has characters.” </p> <p>It is fascinating to hear these basic building blocks of story being spoken of with such trepidation. But if VR is to move beyond its “train approaching the screen” stage, this is attitude that must be taken.</p> <p> </p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Tim Cook has spoken to Apple employees in a closed Q&amp;A about his decision to meet with US president-elect Donald Trump, arguing that it’s more important to engage than stand on the sidelines “yelling”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tim-cook\">Cook</a> also answered employee questions about the perception that Apple has abandoned its Mac line of desktop computers, and about what he thinks most differentiates the company from its competitors.</p> <p>Although unsurprisingly deferential in tone, the questions nonetheless provide the clearest insight yet into Cook’s thinking about the election of Trump, who openly and repeatedly railed against Apple in his campaign for the company’s lack of US manufacturing jobs, offshoring of capital, and refusal to aid the FBI in hacking into an iPhone once used by a dead terrorist.</p> <p>“Last week you joined other tech leaders to meet President-elect Donald Trump,” the questioner said. “How important is it for Apple to engage with governments?”</p> <p>Cook replied: “It’s very important. Governments can affect our ability to do what we do. They can affect it in positive ways and they can affect in not so positive ways. What we do is focus on the policies. Some of our key areas of focus are on privacy and security, education. They’re on advocating for human rights for everyone, and expanding the definition of human rights. They’re on the environment and really combating climate change, something we do by running our business on 100 percent renewable energy.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32cecb82a1f8111371fa217f6780144d2c8bdcf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32cecb82a1f8111371fa217f6780144d2c8bdcf4/0_189_4724_2834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(L-R) Amazon’s chief Jeff Bezos, Larry Page of Alphabet, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Vice President elect Mike Pence, President-elect Donald Trump, Peter Thiel, co-founder and former CEO of PayPal, Tim Cook of Apple and Safra Catz of Oracle attend a meeting at Trump Tower.

Clary/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He added: “There’s a large number of those issues, and the way that you advance them is to engage. Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be. The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it’s in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage. And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it’s very important to do that because you don’t change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best. In many ways, it’s a debate of ideas.<br /></p> <p>“We very much stand up for what we believe in. We think that’s a key part of what Apple is about. And we’ll continue to do so.”<br /></p> <p>The question and answer, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/tim-cook-explains-to-apple-employees-why-he-met-with-president-elect-trump/\">which TechCrunch verified as legitimate</a>, were followed by a less politically-charged query about Apple’s dedication to desktop computers. “We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in the spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?”, Cook was asked.</p> <p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/apples-tim-cook-assures-employees-that-it-is-committed-to-the-mac-and-that-great-desktops-are-coming/\">His response</a> was that to confirm that yes, “the desktop is very strategic for us. It’s unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance.<br /></p> <p>“Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.”</p> <p>Cook was also asked what he considered Apple’s “biggest differentiator, and what can employees do to foster and advance those efforts?” He argued that the company’s commitment to projects with no clear return on investment was hugely important.</p> <p>“With so many things that we’ve done, we don’t do it because there’s an return on investment. We don’t do it because we know exactly how we’re going to use it. We do it because it’s clear it’s interesting and it might lead somewhere. A lot of the time it doesn’t, but many times it leads us somewhere where we had no idea in the beginning.”</p> <p>Apple declined to comment for this story.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Can a hairdryer really be worth £300? That’s the price of Dyson’s Supersonic. It’s the most expensive consumer option on the market, and by more than a hair’s breadth. We wanted to know if the extra money is worth it, so tested it and four other top-end rivals.</p> <p>Our team of testers – with various different hair types, from dense, tight curls of afro-textured hair to pencil-straight east-Asian hair (type makes a big difference when it comes choosing a good dryer) – put the top brands through their paces, judging how fast they worked, how heavy they felt and most importantly how they made hair feel.</p> <p>Has the Dyson done for hairdryers what it did for vacuums, or was it blown away by the competition? Here’s how they stack up. </p> <h2>Babyliss 3Q Dryer</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45c84622fc64beb9004abf1ab52fe468ec71aa66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45c84622fc64beb9004abf1ab52fe468ec71aa66/0_185_5327_3198/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Babyliss 3Q.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Babyliss 3Q.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Price:</strong> £120</p> <p><strong>Attachments:</strong> 1x styling nozzle</p> <p><strong>Hand weight:</strong> 488g</p> <p><strong>Noise:</strong> 89-93dB – the loudest in our test</p> <p>The Babyliss 3Q promises a lot on the box: faster drying, lighter weight, smooth finish and low noise.</p> <p>While some of the claims seem a little far-fetched – given it was the loudest in the test, one of the heaviest and one of the most difficult to handle because of its long snout – it got good results for most.</p> <p>One tester with straight hair said: “It actually did what it said on the box”. Another tester said it left hair soft, shiny and with volume at the roots, which was a theme with most testers.</p> <p>It only comes with one nozzle, no diffuser and wasn’t anything special for thick curls, leaving them ill-defined and frizzy. And it won’t be much good for those wishing to pack it up and take it to the gym, and cleaning collected fluff out of the back will be a bit of a faff. But if shine and volume past the first couple of hours is what you’re after, the Babyliss delivered for most.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> best for straight shine, but difficult to handle</p> <p>Four stars</p> <h2>Parlux Advance ceramic ionic dryer</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4890a722c11a1cae96751cedffaa450a612feafd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4890a722c11a1cae96751cedffaa450a612feafd/0_145_4943_2966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parlux Advance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parlux Advance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Price:</strong> £110</p> <p><strong>Attachments:</strong> 2 x nozzles</p> <p><strong>Hand weight:</strong> 420g (380g quoted) - lightest in the test</p> <p><strong>Noise:</strong> 85-89.5dB</p> <p>The Parlux Advance ceramic ionic dryer is powerful and compact. It’s the lightest in the bunch and doesn’t sacrifice power despite being the second smallest, after the Dyson.</p> <p>Our testers found it had good temperature control, was easy to handle with a short snout, long cord and ergonomic handle, and dried hair fast. The switches felt solid, if a little old-school compared to some others. The grill at the back twists off easily for cleaning.</p> <p>It was neither the quietest or nor the loudest in our test – still loud enough to block out dialogue from a TV in the room like all the rest.</p> <p>Lack of a diffuser in the box holds it back for curly hair (it’s a £10 extra), while some straight hair testers found it caused their locks to be a bit dry and coarse, but others said it made their hair shiny and soft with no need for straighteners.</p> <p>Its compact form and sturdy build made it a good candidate for those that travel the odd time, but don’t want a full-time travel dryer.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> powerful, compact and easy to handle</p> <p>Four stars</p> <h2>Panasonic Nanoe (EH-NA65)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"790cbe2f478cbf52c0aba47ee8d9d4912744f7b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/790cbe2f478cbf52c0aba47ee8d9d4912744f7b9/0_274_5178_3107/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Panasonic Nanoe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Panasonic Nanoe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Price:</strong> £110</p> <p><strong>Attachments:</strong> 1 styling nozzle, 1 quick-dry nozzle, diffuser</p> <p><strong>Hand weight:</strong> 510g (584g quoted)</p> <p><strong>Noise:</strong> 77-89.5dB – quietest at low power</p> <p>The Panasonic EH-NA65 – horrible name, better performance – split opinion. It promises to reduce the damage caused by brushing using so-callled nanoe to trap moisture in the hair.</p> <p>It’s the biggest and heaviest in the group, but also one of the cheapest, and it comes with two nozzles and a diffuser in the box.</p> <p>Its average-length snout made it more difficult to wield than the Dyson or Parlux, but not quite on the same level as the GHD or Babyliss. Its retro styling in black and pink appealed to some, but it was the power and effectiveness that won it plaudits.</p> <p>It dried curly hair in about half the time of the others, while preventing frizz leading one tester to say she would “buy this dryer in a heartbeat”.</p> <p>The results for people with straight hair were less impressive, with one complaining it gave no lift with average drying. Another said it was just fine, but nothing special.</p> <p>The Panasonic was the quietest at its lowest setting but one of the noisiest at full blast. The filter unclips from the back for easy cleaning.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> brilliant for curly hair</p> <p>Three stars</p> <h2>GHD Aura Professional</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1beca83213b1e3aaf5dca72c0a2688c2cb43240e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1beca83213b1e3aaf5dca72c0a2688c2cb43240e/0_159_5269_3162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"GHD Aura Professional.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">GHD Aura Professional.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Price:</strong> £145</p> <p><strong>Attachments:</strong> 1 styling nozzle</p> <p><strong>Hand weight:</strong> 476g (without power adapter)</p> <p><strong>Noise:</strong> 82-88.5dB</p> <p>The GHD Aura Professional promises “ultimate volume and stunning shine”, and is unusual here because it features an external power adapter, shifting the weight out of the handheld.</p> <p>It had a greater difference between the temperature settings than most others, being almost too hot for some at its highest setting. It was also quieter than some others, sounding almost like a jet engine spooling up and down, and it looks the part, but that’s where the plaudits end.</p> <p>The testers found it was at least 25% slower to dry hair than competitors, with one with straight hair saying it left hair damp, with no lift in the roots at all, thus labelling it “useless”.</p> <p>The lack of a diffuser, or even one available that would fit, meant it struggled with curly hair, too. Testers also found it a lot harder than expected to attach and detach the one supplied nozzle, fearing they would break it with amount of force required. The filter unscrews from the back for easy cleaning.</p> <p>Most described the external power supply as an annoyance rather than a benefit, getting in the way and heavy when travelling.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> one to avoid</p> <p>Two stars</p> <h2>Dyson Supersonic</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9286370f71eaa51926ecf7955c07db64c2c57e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9286370f71eaa51926ecf7955c07db64c2c57e3/0_116_5239_3145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dyson Supersonic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dyson Supersonic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Price:</strong> £300</p> <p><strong>Attachments:</strong> 2x styling nozzles, diffuser</p> <p><strong>Hand weight:</strong> 440g (659g quoted)</p> <p><strong>Noise:</strong> 80-85dB – the quietest at full power in our test</p> <p>The Dyson is the new kid on the block and comes in at double the price of everything else, and with very high expectations.</p> <p>It looks different, hiding the fan in the handle and having the best weight balance of them all. The attachments are held on magnetically, the buttons are digital, it’s very easy to handle and it looks like a piece of technology rather than the same old hairdryer you’ve had for decades. The filter is easy to twist off and clean, as are the attachments, and without burning yourself if it’s still hot from use.</p> <p>Without the nozzles on it was powerful enough, relatively quiet and with a more pleasing tone than most, but it still made hearing the TV difficult. When an attachment was added, the Dyson came undone, with the nozzles significantly reducing the power and airflow. One tester described it as the “Lamborghini of hairdryers” because it was all show.</p> <p>One straight-haired tester said it left hair shiny, with fewer fly away hairs, but flat and overly dry. Another said it made hair feel like “like duckling’s feathers: flat and fluffy rather than sleek and voluminous”.</p> <p>With the included diffuser one tester said it reduced to a power level “akin to blowing through a drinking straw” making it next to useless.</p> <p>It looks good on the shelf, cleaning the filter is as easy as unscrewing it from the handle, and works just fine without an attachment, but is that really enough for £300?</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> fancy tech doesn’t make for a good hairdryer</p> <p>One star</p>',\n",

On day one, numerous autonomous vehicles – which have a driver in the front seat who can take control – were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/dec/15/uber-self-driving-car-drives-through-red-light-in-san-francisco-video\">caught running red lights</a> and committing a range of traffic violations. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/16/uber-self-driving-cars-california-illegal-unethical-tactics\">Self-driving cars: Uber\\'s open defiance of California shines light on brazen tactics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite threats of legal action from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/14/uber-self-driving-cars-run-red-lights-san-francisco\">department of motor vehicles</a> (DMV) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/16/uber-defies-california-self-driving-cars-san-francisco\">California’s attorney general, Kamala Harris</a>, Uber refused to back down on Friday, claiming its rejection of government authority was “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/16/uber-defies-california-self-driving-cars-san-francisco\">an important issue of principle</a>”.</p> <p>Concerns are mounting about how the cars behave in dense urban environments, particularly in San Francisco, where there are an estimated <a href=\"http://www.sfexaminer.com/annual-bike-count-shows-commutes-sf-nearly-9-percent/\">82,000 bike trips</a> each day across more than <a href=\"https://www.sfmta.com/about-sfmta/blog/san-francisco%E2%80%99s-surge-biking-continues\">200 miles of cycling lanes</a>. </p> <p>The San Francisco Bicycle Coalition has released a <a href=\"http://www.sfbike.org/news/a-warning-to-people-who-bike-self-driving-ubers-and-right-hook-turns/\">warning about Uber’s cars</a> based on staff members’ first-hand experiences in the vehicles. When the car was in “self-driving” mode, the coalition’s executive director, who tested the car two days before the launch, observed it twice making an “unsafe right-hook-style turn through a bike lane”. </p> <p>That means the car crossed the bike path at the last minute in a manner that posed a direct threat to cyclists. The maneuver also appears to <a href=\"https://www.sfbike.org/news/bike-lanes-and-right-turns/\">violate state law</a>, which mandates that a right-turning car merge into the bike lane before making the turn to avoid a crash with a cyclist who is continuing forward.</p> <p>“It’s one of the biggest causes of collisions,” said coalition spokesman Chris Cassidy, noting that the group warned Uber of the problem. Company officials told the coalition that Uber was working on the issue but failed to mention that the self-driving program would begin two days later without permits, he said. </p> <p>“The fact that they know there’s a dangerous flaw in the technology and persisted in a surprise launch,” he said, “shows a reckless disregard for the safety of people in our streets.” </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The fact that they know there’s a dangerous flaw in the technology and persisted … shows reckless disregard for safety</p> <footer> <cite>Chris Cassidy, San Francisco Bicycle Coalition</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler told the Guardian in an email that “engineers are continuing to work on the problem”, and said that the company has instructed drivers to take control when approaching right turns on a street with a bike lane. She did not respond to questions about how the cars, Volvo XC90s, detect cyclists and what kind of training and testing the firm conducted before implementation.</p> <p>Linda Bailey, executive director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials, which has raised formal objections to <a href=\"http://nacto.org/2016/06/23/nacto-releases-policy-recommendations-for-automated-vehicles/\">partially automated vehicles</a>, said research raises serious alarms about the ability of drivers to properly intervene in semi-autonomous cars. </p> <p>“It’s very clear that people are not good at paying attention,” she said, adding, “We’re waiting for enough people to die for something to happen. It’s not a great way to make policy.” </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/dec/15/uber-self-driving-car-drives-through-red-light-in-san-francisco-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5g6h8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2976974\"            data-video-name=\"Uber self-driving car drives through red light in San Francisco – video\"            data-video-provider=\"Luxor Cab San Francisco\\ufeff\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-585257f7e4b0d14acd717cd7\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/12/15/161215uber_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/12/15/161215uber.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/12/15/161215uber_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/dec/15/uber-self-driving-car-drives-through-red-light-in-san-francisco-video\">Uber self-driving car drives through red light in San Francisco</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Local advocates noted that the Uber cars have been caught doing four out of the <a href=\"http://sfgov.org/scorecards/percentage-citations-top-five-causes-collisions\">top five causes</a> of collisions or injuries in the city – running red lights, going through stop signs, unsafe turns and failing to yield to pedestrians. </p> <p>“These behaviors we’re seeing,” said Nicole Ferrara, executive director of advocacy group Walk San Francisco, “are some of the most dangerous behaviors in San Francisco that lead to traffic deaths and severe injuries.” </p> <p>Carlo Ratti, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and director of the Senseable City Lab, noted that the only way to expand self-driving technology is to start testing cars in the real world. But he said the programs must be done in cooperation with regulators, especially considering that the vehicles have to make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/23/self-driving-car-safety-study-pedestrian-crashes\">complex ethical</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/22/self-driving-cars-moral-dilemmas\">moral decisions</a>. </p> <p>“It’s important that government has a say into how the car is programmed,” he said. </p> <p>Imperfect self-driving vehicles could still be <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/08/self-driving-cars-safer-than-those-driven-by-humans-bob-lutz.html\">significantly safer</a> than traditional cars, said Jeffrey Tumlin, director of Oakland’s department of transportation. </p> <p>But he also noted that “bike lanes present a unique challenge for driverless technology”, because cyclists are agile and can travel at high speeds. “It can be more difficult to predict their behavior,” he said, explaining that engineers are already struggling to navigate vehicle responses to pedestrians, which tend to be simpler.</p> <p>Tumlin said the technology could help improve safety in the long run, but added, “I get uncomfortable with private industry doing their experimentation in the public right of way without first collaborating with the public.” </p> <p>Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>France is considering appointing an official internet ombudsman to regulate complaints about online material in order to prevent excessive censorship and preserve free speech.</p> <p>A bill establishing a “content qualification assessment procedure” <a href=\"http://www.senat.fr/leg/ppl16-151.html\">has been tabled in the French senate</a> and the initiative was debated last week at a high level meeting attended by senators and judges as well as policy officers from Google and Twitter.</p> <p>The aim is to provide a simple procedure that will support firms operating online who are uncertain of their legal liabilities and to prevent over-zealous removal or censorship of material merely because it is the subject of a complaint. It could be copied by other European jurisdictions.</p> <p>Dan Shefets, a Danish lawyer who works in Paris has developed the proposal with the French senator Nathalie Goulet, said: “The problem which an internet ombudsman addresses applies to all countries in Europe [because] member states have to work with the e-commerce directive. </p> <p>“According to the directive, internet service providers (ISPs) face both penal and civil liability as soon as they are made aware of allegedly illicit content. One consequence of such liability is that smaller companies take down such content for fear of later sanctions.</p> <p>“The risk to freedom of speech is real and significant as a consequence not only of the directive, but also of growing pressure on ISPs all over Europe and the world for that matter”.</p> <p>The idea is that a rapid response from the internet ombudsman, whose office would need to be appropriately staffed, would either order the material to be taken down or allow it to remain. As long as ISPs complied with the rulings, they would not face any fine or punishment.</p> <p>David Wright, of the UK Safer Internet Centre, said the closest existing model was Australia’s e-safety commissioner which provides a complaints service for children experiencing cyber-bullying.</p> <p>Shefets, who founded the Association for Accountability and Internet Democracy (AAID) in 2014, is also working with Unesco to develop the project particularly to deal with material deemed to be encouraging radicalisation. </p> <p>He is also planning to present his scheme to the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe. Shefets became interested in regulating online complaints after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/nov/13/google-french-arm-fines-right-to-be-forgotten\">taking a case against Google in 2014</a> which resulted in the US firm being fined €1,000 a day until an online defamatory article was removed. </p> <p>He believes an internet ombudsman will help smaller companies that cannot afford large legal departments to assess the risks of material they host online. “It would help them compete against the big players, who already have massive legal departments and access to lawyers without any financial difficulties,” he explained.</p> <p>“If we don’t put in place some sort of mechanism which will protect freedom of speech while at the same time increasing accountability, it will be too easy to justify repressive [legislative] regimes.”<br /></p>',\n",

Since the decision-making criteria are essentially learnt by the computer, rather than being pre-programmed by humans, the exact logic behind decisions is often opaque, even to the scientists who wrote the software.</p> <p>“Even if we do have access to the innards of the algorithm, they are getting so complicated it’s almost futile to get inside them,” said Srebro. “The whole point of machine learning is to build magical black boxes.”</p> <p>To get around this, Srebro and colleagues devised a way to test for discrimination simply by analysing the data going into a programme and the decisions coming out the other end.</p> <p>“Our criteria does not look at the innards of the learning algorithm,” said Srebro. “It just looks at the predictions it makes.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/18/official-guidance-robot-ethics-british-standards-institute\">Do no harm, don\\'t discriminate: official guidance issued on robot ethics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their approach, called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02413\">Equality of Opportunity in Supervised Learning</a>, works on the basic principle that when an algorithm makes a decision about an individual - be it to show them an online ad or award them parole - the decision should not reveal anything about the individual’s race or gender beyond what might be gleaned from the data itself.</p> <p>For instance, if men were on average twice as likely to default on bank loans than women, and if you knew that a particular individual in a dataset had defaulted on a loan, you could reasonably conclude they were more likely (but not certain) to be male.</p> <p>However, if an algorithm calculated that the most profitable strategy for a lender was to reject all loan applications from men and accept all female applications, the decision would precisely confirm a person’s gender.</p> <p>“This can be interpreted as inappropriate discrimination,” said Srebro.</p> <p>The US financial regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has already expressed an interest in using the method to assess banks.</p> <p>However, others have raised concerns that the approach appears to side-step any requirement for transparency about how decisions made by algorithms are actually reached.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/08/facial-recognition-technology-racial-bias-police\">\\'I think my blackness is interfering\\': does facial recognition show racial bias?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alan Winfield, professor of robot ethics at the University of the West of England, said: “Imagine there’s a court case for one of these decisions.

By using a company in a lower tax country, in this case Ireland, Airbnb looks to have arranged its affairs to avoid tax throughout Europe including the UK.”</p> <p>A spokesman for Airbnb said: “We don’t make important, long-term business decisions on the basis of taxation”. </p> <p>“We follow the rules and pay all the tax we owe in the places we do business,” he said. “Corporation tax is a tax on profit, and Airbnb is a young company investing heavily in our future. Airbnb hosts keep 97% of the price they charge to rent their space and the overwhelming amount of money generated by the Airbnb platform stays with hosts and their communities.” </p> <p>Airbnb was established in 2008 and is now backed by multiple venture capital firms including Google Capital. It claims to have more than two million properties available to rent in 191 countries. </p> <p>Airbnb’s UK tax payments were detailed in annual reports filed last month by its two British subsidiaries and provide a rare snapshot of the scale of its booming business.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/01/airbnb-introduces-90-day-a-year-limit-for-london-hosts\">Airbnb introduces 90-day annual limit for London hosts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Airbnb has two UK firms to handle payments from around the world and conduct marketing in the UK. While hundreds of millions of pounds in rental payments pass through the companies, earning commission from both the guest and the host, Airbnb’s UK arms recorded £145m as turnover in the UK, of which just £1.4m was taxable profit. </p> <p>The biggest cost recorded was a £100m foreign exchange loss caused by Airbnb receiving cash for rentals in multiple currencies and delays, sometimes of several months, between receiving payment from a guest and paying it out to a host.</p> <p>Airbnb said the UK company processes payments from customers around the world on behalf of its Irish HQ. The “significant costs” of that process – such as any foreign exchanges losses – are reimbursed by Ireland at a profit which is then taxed in the UK, it said.</p> <p>Airbnb said that its international HQ was based in Ireland to “capitalise on Ireland’s global reputation for technology and utilise the vast tech-savvy and bilingual workforce that Ireland has built.”</p> <p>But Richard Murphy, a chartered account and director of Tax Research UK, said he thought Airbnb was “dumping its foreign exchange losses in this country to get tax relief on them but the income to which these foreign exchange losses relate never comes near the UK”. </p> <p>“We get none of the upside on tax from Airbnb’s real income, which is taxed in Ireland, but are giving away tax relief on their costs,” he said. “The net result is to significantly increase the overall level of profits Airbnb can enjoy at low tax rates.”<br /></p> <p>Murphy said cost reimbursement “is not the basis on which international tax rules are meant to work”. </p> <p>“They are meant to ensure businesses are taxed on a commercial basis. It is not clear that the UK is ensuring that is happening and in the process Airbnb may be winning from our failure.”</p> <p>Airbnb said this was untrue and its UK arm is taxed on a commercial basis and that cost reimbursement is a common way of doing business.</p> <p>The accounts also reveal that Airbnb believes “future legislation may negatively impact Airbnb’s ability to operate as it currently does”.</p> <p>It states: “The sharing economy in which Airbnb operates is a relatively new economic sector and currently the status of legislation governing it can be vague at best.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 19 December 2016 to clarify a description of Airbnb Payments UK Ltd’s costs and revenue.</p>',\n",

TVs the size of small aquariums can be bought for such paltry sums that everyone, it seems, now owns a domestic cinema of sorts.</p> <p>A projector takes that to the next level, creating the illusion of living room as auditorium for a fraction of the cost of the equivalent television. You don’t even need to splash out on a dedicated projector screen; any patch of white or lightly coloured wall will suffice. Which one to choose, though?</p> <p>Tiny pocket projectors can be tucked away in a drawer or a bag, but need darker rooms. Short-throw projectors perform miracles with light, bending photons from impossible positions right below your screen, but you’ll pay for the privilege. Others add powerful speakers, software voodoo to magically improve picture quality… the choices are many and confusing. Here’s a roundup of five of the most interesting and effective around, to help you find a projector to light up your domestic life.</p> <h2>RIF6 Cube </h2> <p><strong>£270, 50 lumens, 854 X 480 resolution </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98ec2f555f362681c70458ecdaf62ccb1f6c5547\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98ec2f555f362681c70458ecdaf62ccb1f6c5547/0_340_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The RIF6 Cube\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If hobbits were home-cinema enthusiasts they’d probably be tempted by the <a href=\"https://rif6.com\">RIF6</a>, a diminutive, cube-shaped projector suitable for the tiniest of hands – and budgets. Finished in glittering silver and obsidian black, like some rare Elvish artefact, the RIF6 is a surprisingly utilitarian device. It can play back video from phones, laptops and tablets directly through its MHL-compatible HDMI input and also plays files from memory cards. In the box is a tripod of equally compact dimensions, lending the projector Ent-like stability on most surfaces, plus a remote control and a full set of cables. It even has its very own rechargeable internal battery. This is a portable projector, and it has a lower resolution than its more lumpen relations, so the image isn’t as sharp or bright. But draw the curtains, snuff the candles and big screens of up to 2.5 metres across are surprisingly watchable.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: Don’t go on any quest without one. </strong></p> <h2>Philips Screeneo 2.0</h2> <p><strong>£1,400, 2,000 lumens, 1,920 X 1,080 resolution </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69b4c24c4a9597108a1b2019bc7d1b4a1f92e0a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69b4c24c4a9597108a1b2019bc7d1b4a1f92e0a4/0_457_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philips Screeneo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Reminiscent more of a chicken bucket than a means of recreating the cinema experience in the living room, the Philips <a href=\"http://www.philips.co.uk/c-p/HDP2510_EU/screeneo-full-hd-projector/support#supportcontainer\">Screeneo 2.0</a> offers a unique blend of features. Unlike most projectors, which must be placed metres away from the surface on to which it projects, the Philips can nestle in much closer proximity. Positioned 10cm away from a wall, a 127cm display can be created; from 42cm, that inflates to a vision-filling 2.5 metres, and with high brightness and contrast its 1080p image is watchable with and without the curtains drawn. The Screeneo’s credit list of talents doesn’t end there, though: in the base of the bucket sits a bank of speakers capable of delivering full-bodied sound to embarrass the output of many a shrill LCD TV. Not many projectors are this good and this flexible, but the price matches its list of capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: Flexible but expensive.</strong></p> <h2>Optoma HD28DSE</h2> <p><strong>£700, 3,000 lumens, 1,920 x 1,080 resolution</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfacb6aa885e88119ed823d3c5adeaa140fa807e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfacb6aa885e88119ed823d3c5adeaa140fa807e/0_28_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Optoma HD28DSE\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Those seeking the finest image quality and biggest screen can spend thousands on a TV, but the <a href=\"http://www.optomaeurope.com/projectorproduct/hd28dse\">Optoma</a> can deliver acres more for far less. The ace up this machine’s sleeve is its Darbee image processing. Nothing to do with horse racing or contests between teams that happen to be cartographically close, this is instead a clever piece of imaging wizardry that amplifies textures and details to an inconceivable extent. Projected images take on near physical presence, skin pores are displayed with medical detail and hair looks so palpable one feels almost able to pluck it. It’s the next best thing to going to the cinema itself, and its long lamp life of up to 8,000 hours means you won’t have to pay the ticket price for a replacement for years.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <strong>A box-office smash.</strong></p> <h2>BenQ W2000</h2> <p><strong>£799, 2,000 lumens, 1,920 X 1,080 resolution</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df8f009543d3d1acf3d8e0fcc32eddc0c00dfb70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df8f009543d3d1acf3d8e0fcc32eddc0c00dfb70/56_0_1363_818/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BenQ W2000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/picture/2013/jul/11/lumi-re-brothers-film\">Lumière brothers</a> would have gaped, slack-jawed at the cinematic capabilities of the <a href=\"http://www.benq.co.uk/product/projector/w2000/\">BenQ W2000</a>. Squeezed into a unit the size of a gentleman’s valise is a celluloid-beating, movie theatre in a box, able to recreate wall-filling moving images brimful with dazzling detail. The key to the W2000’s appeal is the adaptability of its lens, which can be shifted up, down, in and out, as if it were on a camera boom, for fine-tuning the position of the image without the anguish of quality degradation. It’s whisper-quiet compared with its colleagues, overflowing with connections and effortless to operate. Your only problem may be dragging yourself away from the screen.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: Picture perfect but pricey.</strong></p> <h2>ViewSonic Lightstream PJD7720HD</h2> <p><strong>£479, 3,200 lumens, 1,920 x 1,080 resolution</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17d15f36144717c40d25626b655a4a86528ec0ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17d15f36144717c40d25626b655a4a86528ec0ed/356_462_3506_2104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ViewSonic Lightstream PJD7720HD\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.viewsoniceurope.com/uk/products/projectors/PJD7720HD.php\">ViewSonic</a> is our least expensive “proper projector” and yet its cast of specifications is a laundry list of high-tech, home-cinema buzzwords. It has a six-segment colour wheel, a maximum brightness rating of 3,200 lumens, a maximum contrast of 22,000:1 and a Blu-ray-ready resolution of 1,080p. In isolation no one would lament the quality of its image. In juxtaposition with its rivals, however, it can’t match the intensity of the Optoma or the immaculate refinement of the BenQ. It lacks some essentials, too, with a measly selection of inputs and a non-backlit remote control, while its fan is a touch obstreperous. But the price is more palatable, you may find yourself making excuses for it instead.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: Basic but beautiful.</strong></p>',\n",

The driver glanced over, then his eyes swivelled and he gawped. What he saw in the gloom was a turquoise convertible <a href=\"https://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/en-GB/home.html\">Rolls-Royce</a>, its hood dropped to reveal a pristine leather interior. The imposing car, its chrome glinting like star dust, is a sumptuous vision on any road, let alone a boring junction in south London. But what made the moment more surreal was that sitting in the car were David Bowie and Sid Vicious… Well, <em>actually</em>, it was me and a friend going to a 50th birthday party. Theme: Dead Rockers. I was the punk so why was I worried about getting black hair dye on the white headrest? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cf05372195411ec5dd4d9d69ec3a2c31b85064d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cf05372195411ec5dd4d9d69ec3a2c31b85064d/0_151_4540_2723/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside story: the cosseting interior of the Rolls Royce Dawn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the cosseting interior of the Rolls Royce Dawn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before the Roller was delivered, friends asked if I was ready to spend the weekend being hated. I’d be wafting around in a smog of smugness, while pedestrians and road users scowled at me. In fact, the exact opposite happened. Everywhere I went, people smiled and waved. One person punched the air in delight. Dozens approached and <em>congratulated</em> me on the car, gazing at it in wonder. Other super cars elicit a much more hostile reaction. Sit in a Porsche, a Ferrari or a Lamborghini and you feel the disdain heavy upon you. Is it a British thing? Do we all nurture a lingering reverence for this most historic of marques? Or maybe it’s just that Rolls-Royce makes the best cars the world has ever seen, and for more than a century has been the <em>ne plus ultra</em> of engineering as art as performance. On top of that the new <a href=\"https://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/en-GB/dawn.html\">Dawn</a> (which sounds like a morning prayer group) is undeniably striking.</p> <p>Although the Dawn is a fresh start for Rolls, it doesn’t deviate much from the template laid down by BMW when it took over the helm of the great British marque in 1999.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96e852e4ce424765ab1e316572c68b74d8740d38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96e852e4ce424765ab1e316572c68b74d8740d38/0_247_7360_4418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blue sky thinking: the new Dawn’s fabric roof folds neatly into the boot at the touch of a button\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blue sky thinking: the new Dawn’s fabric roof folds neatly into the boot at the touch of a button</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Up front there is a gargantuan 6.6-litre twin-turbo V12, and behind that there is all the deep-muscle cosseting that four adults can endure while being propped up in lounge chairs surrounded by chrome, leather, wood and little shiny buttons. Despite its size the Dawn is comparatively drivable. It’s usable, in a daily (if preposterous) way. I took it to Sainsbury’s, twice – one has to eat.</p> <p>The fact that Kate Moss bought one over the summer also tells you that the Dawn brings street kudos that may have eluded Rolls before.</p> <p>Would Sid Vicious buy one? Nah, but the designers at Rolls-Royce would have been only too happy to create a punk-themed bespoke ride for him, complete with shredded leather and safety pins…</p> <p><em>Email Martin at </em><a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\"><em>martin.love@observer.co.uk</em></a><em> or follow him on Twitter</em><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinLove166\">@MartinLove166</a></em></p>',\n",

Is that ethical?”</p> <p>Google and others argue their results are a mirror to society, not their responsibility. As a chartered engineer, I strongly agree with Ms Cadwalladr that companies such as Google, Facebook and Uber need to take responsibility for the unintended consequences of the algorithms and machine learning that drive their profits. They can bring huge benefits and great apps but we need a tech-savvy government to minimise the downside by opening up algorithms to regulation as well as legislating for greater consumer ownership of data and control of the advertising revenue it generates.<br /><strong>Chi Onwurah MP</strong><br />Houses of Commons<br />London SW1</p> <p>In all the justifiable furore over the pernicious influence of rightwing websites and how it’s reinforced by Google’s algorithms, I’m surprised no\\xa0one has mentioned one longstanding, though admittedly partial, answer: don’t use Google! Not as difficult as you might think.</p> <p>For several years now, I’ve avoided using Google (to the extent of barring its cookies) and used DuckDuckGo (see <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\" title=\"\">duckduckgo.com</a>) for all searches.

Many of the recommendations are commendable; however, one fails to protect children. The recommendation to ban all employment below a minimum legal age (articles 84 and 85), a policy set out in the International Labour Organisation’s Minimum Age Convention 138 (1973), makes the false premise that children are better protected if childhood is free from work.</p> <p>Research has shown this can trigger worse living conditions, reduce education opportunities and push some children into more hazardous and exploitative work. Moreover, age-appropriate safe work can be developmental for children of all ages. That the Minimum Age Convention harms children is now so well established that several dozen researchers and practitioners specialising in child work formed an ad hoc expert group to provide the committee with advice and evidence, arguing that Convention 138 should be revoked or ignored and more effective policy should specifically target work that is dangerous or damaging to children.</p> <p>Monitoring mechanisms need to be in place to ensure children’s work at all ages benefits them and is not hazardous or exploitative and does not conflict with education. This can be done through the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Convention 138 is both harmful and unnecessary.</p> <p><strong>Professor Jo Boyden</strong></p> <p>University of Oxford</p> <p><strong>Dr Ben White</strong></p> <p>Erasmus University, the Netherlands</p> <p><strong>Dr William Myers</strong></p> <p>International Institute for Child Rights and Development, US</p> <p><strong>Professor Priscilla Alderson</strong></p> <p>University College London</p> <p><strong>Dr Bree Akesson</strong></p> <p>Wilfrid Laurier University, Canada</p> <p><strong>Dr Nicola Ansell</strong></p> <p>Brunel University</p> <p><strong>Professor Michael Bourdillon</strong></p> <p>University of Zimbabwe</p> <p><strong>Dr Rachel Burr</strong></p> <p>Social Work &amp; Education, University of Sussex</p> <p><strong>Richard Carothers</strong></p> <p>Partners in Technology Exchange, Canada</p> <p><strong>Dr Kristen Cheney</strong></p> <p>ISS, The Hague</p> <p><strong>Professor John Cockburn</strong></p> <p>Universite Laval, Canada</p> <p><strong>Dr Tara Collins</strong></p> <p>Ryerson University, Canada</p> <p><strong>Dr Philip Cook</strong></p> <p>International Institute for Child Rights and Development, Canada</p> <p><strong>Dr Philip Cook</strong></p> <p>University of Edinburgh</p> <p><strong>Dr GIna Crivello</strong></p> <p>University of Oxford</p> <p><strong>Dr Jennifer Driscoll</strong></p> <p>Kings College London</p> <p><strong>Dr Jason Hart</strong></p> <p>University of Bath</p> <p><strong>Professor Roger Hart</strong></p> <p>Graduate Centre of the City University of New York</p> <p><strong>Dr Neil Howard</strong></p> <p>European University Institute</p> <p><strong>Dr Roy Huijsmans</strong></p> <p>International Institute of Social Studies, The Netherlands</p> <p><strong>Dr Antonella Invernizzi</strong></p> <p>independent researcher, France</p> <p><strong>Dr Victor Karunan</strong></p> <p>Chulalongkom University and Mahidol University, Malaysia</p> <p><strong>Dr Natascha Klocker</strong></p> <p>University of Wollongong, Australia</p> <p><strong>Professor Deborah Levison</strong></p> <p>Humphrey School of Public Affairs, Minnesota</p> <p><strong>Professor Manfred Liebel</strong></p> <p>International Academy Berlin</p> <p><strong>Dr Peter Mackie</strong></p> <p>University of Cardiff</p> <p><strong>Dr Stanford Mahati</strong></p> <p>University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa</p> <p><strong>Dr Emma Mawdsley</strong></p> <p>University of Cambridge</p> <p><strong>Dr Virginia Morrow</strong></p> <p>University of Oxford</p> <p><strong>Dr Maria Federica Moscati</strong></p> <p>University of Sussex</p> <p><strong>Dr Sevasti-Melissa Nolas</strong></p> <p>University of Sussex</p> <p><strong>Samuel Okyere</strong></p> <p>University of Nottingham</p> <p><strong>Dr Alphonce Omolo</strong></p> <p>Lensthru Consultants in Social Development, Kenya</p> <p><strong>Kirsten Pontalti</strong></p> <p>University of Oxford</p> <p><strong>Professor Gina Porter</strong></p> <p>Durham University</p> <p><strong>Kavita Ratna</strong></p> <p>Advocacy of the Concerned for Working Children, India</p> <p><strong>Dr Elsbeth Robson</strong></p> <p>University of Hull</p> <p><strong>Dr Kettie Roelen</strong></p> <p>Institute of Development Studies</p> <p><strong>Dr Jessica Taft</strong></p> <p>University of California</p> <p><strong>Professor Nigel Thomas</strong></p> <p>University of Central Lancashire</p> <p><strong>Dr Dorte Thorsen</strong></p> <p>University of Sussex</p> <p><strong>Professor Kay Tisdall</strong></p> <p>University of Edinburgh</p> <p><strong>Dr Afua Twum-Danso Imoh</strong></p> <p>University of Sheffield</p> <p><strong>Professor Lorraine van Blerk</strong></p> <p>University of Dundee</p> <p><strong>Dr Debbie Watson</strong></p> <p>University of Bristol</p> <h2><strong>Heartless to the homeless</strong></h2> <p>It is a sad indictment of our society that we have driven so many of our citizens on to the streets.

Many readers will know that if it wasn’t for the bank of mum and dad, their children could be among the poor unfortunate homeless.</p> <p>The councils, planners, businesses and security people involved in implementing these draconian measures should hang their heads in shame. I hope they do not sleep well in their comfortable beds.</p> <p>We should have a policy of name and shame. How about printing a league table showing the least compassionate cities and businesses where most of this “defensive architecture” is in place, so that tourists and potential clients can boycott them? These spikes and railings must be in somebody’s parish. I know many church leaders do good voluntary work but why don’t we hear their voices in the media making comparisons to the parable of the Samaritan and the innkeeper? As for sanctuary and best use of churches, I’m sure Jesus would be delighted to see the homeless sleeping on the pews at night time.

One week ago, I typed “did the hol” into a Google search box and clicked on its autocomplete suggestion, “Did the Holocaust happen?” And there, at the top of the list, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/11/google-frames-shapes-and-distorts-how-we-see-world\">was a link to Stormfront</a>, a neo-Nazi white supremacist website and an article entitled “Top 10 reasons why the Holocaust didn’t happen”.</p> <p>On Monday, Google confirmed it would not remove the result: “We are saddened to see that hate organisations still exist. The fact that hate sites appear in search results does not mean that Google endorses these views.”</p> <p>The <em>Independent</em> ran the story. As did <em>Fortune</em>. And the <em>Daily Mail</em>. And the <em>Jerusalem Post</em>. And the Drudge Report. But Google held firm. <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/19/david-duke-former-klan-leader-applauds-trumps-cabi/\">David Duke</a>, former imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, tweeted his support for the decision. And over on Stormfront – the website where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/22/anders-breivik-massacre-one-of-us-anne-seierstad\">Anders Breivi</a>k nurtured his ideas – members celebrated.</p> <p>And still, anyone searching for information about the Holocaust – if it was real, if it happened, if it was a hoax, if it was fake – was being served up neo-Nazi propaganda as the top result.</p> <p>Until Friday. When I gamed Google’s algorithm. I succeeded in doing what Google said was impossible. I, a journalist with almost zero computer knowhow, succeeded in changing the search order of Google’s results for “did the Holocaust happen” and “was the Holocaust a hoax”. I knocked Stormfront off the top of the list. I inserted Wikipedia’s entry on the Holocaust as the number one result. I displaced a lie with a fact.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af43f4a9f036e7c6b0854e81aa6be40b407a3dcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af43f4a9f036e7c6b0854e81aa6be40b407a3dcb/0_4_1010_606/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Screengrab\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google search screengrab.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Google</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How did I achieve this impossible feat? Not through writing articles. Or shaming the company into action. I did it with the only language that Google understands: money. Google has shown that it will not respond to outrage or public sentiment or any sense of morality or ethics. It does not accept that leading people with a genuine inquiry about whether the Holocaust happened to a neo-Nazi website is grossly irresponsible or that it demeans the memory of the six million Jews who died. But it was prepared to take my cold, hard cash. A Google spokesman said: “We never want to make money from searches for Holocaust denial, and we don’t allow regular advertising on those terms.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/11/google-frames-shapes-and-distorts-how-we-see-world\">Google is not ‘just’ a platform. It frames, shapes and distorts how we see the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet, it has already made £24.01 out of me. (This was the initial cost – it has since risen to £289.) Because this is what I did: I paid to place a Google advert at the top of its search results. “The Holocaust really happened,” I wrote as the headline to my advert. And below it: “6 million Jews really did die. These search results are propagating lies. Please take action.”</p> <p>I did this via Google’s AdWords programme. This is the bedrock of everything that Google does, its core business: selling ads against search results. It’s this that contributes the bulk of the $5bn (£4.07bn) profit that Google makes per quarter.</p> <p>AdWords helpfully suggested possible “Ad group ideas” and search terms that included: “holocaust hoax”, “was the holocaust fake” and “did the holocaust happen”. And it told me how many searches a month are made for these terms: all in, 9,480. Or 113,760 a year. Or the population of Cambridge.</p> <p>All of whom are being informed by Google that the Holocaust didn’t happen. And are being directed to Stormfront, the website where Anders Breivik used to hang out online and whose members celebrated the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/16/labour-mp-jo-cox-shot-in-west-yorkshire\">Jo Cox</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa95d06c9f876610222bfa9e178bd14bc5ca2e9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa95d06c9f876610222bfa9e178bd14bc5ca2e9d/0_263_4205_2523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jewish children, survivors of Auschwitz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jewish children, survivors of Auschwitz, Poland, February 1945.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lilian Black, chair of <a href=\"http://holocaustlearning.org/\">The Holocaust Survivors Friendship Association</a>, and the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, called it appalling. “I’m so shocked. Google has a responsibility for its actions. It’s almost like saying we know that the trains are running into Birkenau, but we’re not responsible for what’s happening at the end of it. They shape people’s thinking and are disparaging the memory of people like my grandparents who were gassed.</p> <p>“More than that, it’s where this leads. It’s about its relevance today as much as the past. Our learning centre is in Kirklees, where Jo Cox was murdered. What is the matter with people? Can’t they see where this leads? And to have a huge worldwide organisation refusing to acknowledge this. That’s what they think their role is? To be a bystander? To just stand by? They’re committing a hate crime, in my view.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/2016/sep/19/how-to-contact-the-guardian-securely\">How to contact the Guardian securely</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A Google spokesman said: “The goal of search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users. Clearly, we don’t always get it right, but we continually work to improve our algorithms.</p> <p>“This is a challenging problem, and something we’re thinking deeply about in terms of how we can do a better job. Search is a reflection of the content that exists on the web. The fact that hate sites appear in search results in no way means that Google endorses these views.”</p> <p>Frank Pasquale, professor of law at Maryland University, a leading expert on “algorithmic accountability”, called it “gross hypocrisy”. “They frequently say that Google search is not just about giving you a list of sources, but rather to answer your question. And empirically speaking, people tend to treat Google like an authority. So this is an appalling shirking of responsibility. It’s about money. It always is. The commercial imperative trumps all other aims at the company, including moral ones.”</p> <p>The issue is not that Google is refusing to “edit” the results about the Holocaust, the deeper question is about why Stormfront is number one. Google said: “We handle billions of queries every day and our goal is to give you the most relevant answer to your query as quickly as possible. The issue you have raised is one where we are very unhappy with the quality of the results.</p> <p>“While it might seem tempting to fix the results of an individual query by hand, that approach does not scale to the many different variants of that query and the queries that we have not yet seen. So we prefer to take a scaleable algorithmic approach to fix problems, rather than removing these one by one.”</p> <p>But Danny Sullivan, editor of <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/\">Search Engine Land</a>, and a leading expert on search, in an article that was largely sympathetic to the challenge facing Google, still noted: “It’s bizarre that something like that Holocaust denial post is showing tops in Google. It has no great number of links pointing at it, according to a Moz tool I used [a method of examining where a website links to]. The Wikipedia page below it should carry far more authority.”</p> <p>And he suggests a reason why it doesn’t: that Google has changed its algorithm to reward popular results over authoritative ones. For the reason that it makes Google more money.</p> <p>• <em>If Stormfront is back at number one when you read this, it’s because I’ve run out of funds.

Some hark back to the introduction of threshing machines into 19th-century agriculture and say that train drivers are the new luddites. Far from being the beginning of the end, the disappearance of farm jobs was a precursor to the growth of the manufacturing and services sectors that not only soaked up the rural working class, but also an expanding labour force.</p> <p>On the other side of the fence are economists who argue that the extraordinary scope of today’s software revolution, from voice recognition to problem-solving algorithms, is a different beast and will knock out jobs in almost every industry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87acb964e09491736bfbec4d4dd4a959b78b3bad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87acb964e09491736bfbec4d4dd4a959b78b3bad/0_36_3327_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon fails to replace the workers displaced by its online model.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon fails to replace the workers displaced by its online model.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sakuma/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-ford-5a70428\" title=\"\">Martin Ford, author of <em>Rise of the Robots</em>,</a> which won the <em>Financial Times</em>/McKinsey business book of the year in 2015, says that a large percentage of jobs are, at some level, routine and can be broken down into a discrete set of tasks that are repeated over and over each day.</p> <p>He believes the sheer volume of jobs lost should force governments to consider a minimum income for all workers. He says: “As machine-learning and robotics technologies advance, a large fraction of these job types will be at risk of being automated away.”</p> <p>In the US, automation has worked its way up the food chain for some, with the effect of shunting workers into lower-skilled jobs on lower wages.</p> <p>There is plenty of American academic literature on the effects of automation, but only one study has taken a detailed look at wages over the last 30 years and appeared to show the effect on individuals’ living standards.</p> <p>Robert Shapiro, a former economic adviser to Bill Clinton who now runs the Sonecon consultancy in Washington, spent six months hacking his way through more than three decades of census data and found that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/sep/06/america-decline-in-wages-can-be-traced-from-the-george-w-bush-era\" title=\"\">most profound impact on the wages of college-educated, middle-income groups </a>arrived along with the internet at the turn of the century.</p> <p>The widespread adoption of technology in almost every industry meant that solid office jobs that paid above-average wages began to disappear at an alarming rate from 2001/2002 onwards. The arc of rising wages during a working life that continued through the 1980s and 1990s, became a decline for many people from their 40s onwards during George W Bush’s presidency. The 2008 financial crash accelerated the process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef0a97b641b4ea3c540333b500a0bbca791551c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef0a97b641b4ea3c540333b500a0bbca791551c5/0_190_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deloitte says 35% of today’s jobs in the UK are at high risk of automation in 10 to 20 years.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deloitte says 35% of today’s jobs in the UK are at high risk of automation in 10 to 20 years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ritchie B.

The UK’s productivity, as measured by hours worked per unit of output, is around 30% less than the US.</p> <p>Step forward Capita, which provides services ranging from electronic tagging for offenders to store-card services for retailers. It said last week that 2,000 office jobs would be made redundant after it found workers assisted by automated robotic technology could achieve “ten times the amount they used to”.</p> <p>“It doesn’t remove the need for an individual but it speeds up how they work, which means you need less people to do it,” the company said.</p> <p>A series of studies by the professional services firm, Deloitte, has argued that the Capita move is a sign that technologies are increasingly behaving like a laxative for employers, flushing out jobs that are no longer needed.</p> <p>Deloitte says 35% of today’s jobs in the UK are at high risk of automation within the next 10 to 20 years. Only four in 10 are in the low-risk category.</p> <p>Across the UK, jobs paying less than £30,000 a year are nearly five times more likely to be replaced by automation than those paying more than £100,000. In London, lower-paid jobs are eight times more likely to be replaced.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8762848b9887c63993d0be02219ca98d32538534\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8762848b9887c63993d0be02219ca98d32538534/0_552_3944_2366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From 2001 onwards, office jobs that paid above-average wages began to disappear.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From 2001 onwards, office jobs that paid above-average wages began to disappear.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Neibel/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The only good news from the surveys is that firms apparently expect to create more of these highly paid jobs.</p> <p>It’s for this reason British university students must behave more like their continental and US counterparts, who often think nothing of educating themselves into their late 20s and amassing a collection of postgraduate qualifications.</p> <p>But the race for better qualifications to win an elite job – one that is better paid and more immune to automation – is going to get tougher as the new breed of almost jobless firms grab the lion’s share of economic activity.</p> <p>Amazon, Google and Facebook, which have seen their incomes and profits grow immeasurably in recent years, are not among the postwar generation of firms desperately automating their processes to stay in business – they automate from the very outset.</p> <p>Twenty years ago, a company with a similar stock market value and number of customers as Facebook would have employed hundreds of thousands more staff than the tech firm does today.</p> <p>Not only does Amazon minimise the amount of tax it pays as a corporation, it fails to replace the sheer volume of workers who are displaced by its online sales model.</p> <p>Rail company Southern says it has no intention of introducing driverless trains, but with driverless cars already being tested, it might not be too long before the technology arrives and train drivers are consigned to being another piece of railway history.</p> <h2>ROBOT WARS</h2> <p>Automation is not just going to rob a vast swath of school leavers and graduates in the developed world of a skilled and well-paid job. The robot wars are also going to disrupt the progress of developing nations as they move from a dependency on agriculture for employment to manufacturing and the services industries.</p> <p>In October, the World Bank said automation threatens nearly seven out of 10 jobs in India and 77% in China. In the UK, four out of 10 of jobs are at risk, according to one report. Here are some of the companies planning to swap staff with robots.</p> <p><strong>Capita </strong>The UK-based company that runs the London congestion charge said it needed to axe 2,000 jobs as part of a cost-cutting drive in response to poor trading. It said it would use the money it saved from sacking thousands of staff to fund investment in automated technology across all of the company’s divisions. It expects to use automation to take on tasks such as IT processing.</p> <p><strong>Uber </strong>The taxi-hailing app was testing driverless cars (above left) in San Francisco until last week, when the California department of motor vehicles ordered it to stop after the cars jumped red lights. The company, which has a deal with Volvo, is pushing ahead with the technology that could see thousands of self-driving cars on the road within a couple of years. Electric car maker Tesla has taken more than 325,000 reservations for its <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/news/tesla-model-3-launch-elon-musk-unveils-new-25000-electric-car/\" title=\"\">Model 3</a>, which has driverless technology and is due to arrive in late 2017. Millions of taxi drivers, lorry drivers and chauffeurs could be put out of work, though there will be jobs managing and maintaining driverless cars.</p> <p><strong>Carl’s Jr </strong>and<strong> Hardee’s </strong>restaurants could become overwhelmingly reliant on self-service if the chief executive of the firm that owns the <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/03/17/automate-fast-food/\" title=\"\">US restaurant chains</a> gets his way.</p> <p>Andy Puzder, inspired by Eatsa, a restaurant where all front-of-house procedures are computerised, says he could afford to invest in healthier food options once he has shed surplus staff.</p> <p>“Millennials like <em>not</em> seeing people,” he said. “I’ve actually seen young people waiting in line to use the kiosk, when there’s a person standing behind the counter, waiting on nobody.”</p> <p><strong>Adidas </strong>The sportswear brand produces 301m pairs of shoes a year and output is growing at more than 10% annually. <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/05/25/adidas-robot-speedfactories/\" title=\"\">A new automated shoe factory in Ansbach, Bavaria</a> (above right) is the answer to its growing pains.

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>You can tell a lot about a car by the people who admire it. When young men swarm it in the streets, you know it is renownedly fast and has red piping. When people at the school gates like it, you know it looks new (there is something about playgrounds – they dampen the petrolheads and amplify a love of tidiness). And when a car, much like the Lexus RX 450h, attracts the attention of men who look like advertising executives (slouchy attire, confident hair, always in their 40s) you know it’s both right-on and a status vehicle.</p> <p>It’s a tricky combination, being fundamentally contradictory: if you care about climate change, you forget about status, surely? Except not really: the Lexus speaks to the crazy mixed-up people we truly are. Its hybrid efficiency has to be weighed against the old-fashioned inefficiency of its two-tonne bulk. It is modern all the way from its shapely headlamp cluster to its cavernous front grille; old school in its leather interior, and the fact that a lot of its not inconsiderable bulk is given over to driver comfort. It’s an SUV in which the passengers feel like they’re in a hot hatch, and the boot could belong to a 70s saloon. Yet the driver feels like she’s in an armchair, and that’s what counts.</p> <p>Emissions are impressive, given its size, but not in the grand scheme of things; so the irritants of a hybrid irked me more. It has a soundless take off, which techies admire, being difficult to achieve; I can’t stand it, because if there’s one thing that really harshes my mellow, it’s nearly running people over. It glides through town, striking but silent, like a getaway vehicle in a Triffids dystopia (Trifftopia?) where people can only hear. It’s luxurious, almost statesmanlike. The seats are not just heated, but ventilated, the satnav is so attentive it’s like having a butler, the speakers are amazing, and there are a gazillion phone chargers, for the busy executive with multiple devices. If it’s a bit cumbersome for city streets, well, those other people should just get out of the way.</p> <p>Motorways are more fun, when the petrol takes over. The hush of the cabin, the precision of the steering and the insouciance in the face of dodgy road surface: all of these shout “class”. I smiled, papally, at other drivers: “Yes, fellow motorwayer. I am as virtuous yet as rich as I look.” And I guess that’s the point. I remain unpersuaded, however, that “looking expensive” is the proper business of the automobile of modernity.</p> <h2>Lexus RX 450h: in numbers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a687ca6ad697d7a5b3dc3dccf0c0a9ed2ea6642b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a687ca6ad697d7a5b3dc3dccf0c0a9ed2ea6642b/1187_0_2669_2670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lexus RX interior\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Price</strong> £59,935<br /><strong>Top speed</strong> 124mph <br /><strong>Acceleration</strong> 0-62mpg in 7.7 seconds<br /><strong>Combined fuel consumptio</strong>n 51.4mpg<br /><strong>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions </strong>127g/km<br /><strong>Eco rating </strong>7/10<br /><strong>Cool rating</strong> 6/10</p>',\n",

The city is home to Uber’s self-driving-car research facility, and the pilot program was met with enthusiasm by local officials.</p> <p>But in San Francisco, the pilot program has so far been a public relations catastrophe. </p> <p>Two self-driving Ubers were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/14/uber-self-driving-cars-run-red-lights-san-francisco\">observed running red lights</a> on Wednesday, the first day of the pilot. The company blamed the traffic violations on “human error” and has suspended the drivers involved. However, the company was not asked about the red light violations during a conference call with reporters Friday and has not responded to follow-up questions seeking an explanation. </p> <p>The San Francisco police department’s traffic division was not informed about Uber’s program until after it had begun, according to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sfexaminer.com/sfpd-traffic-division-unaware-self-driving-uber-fleet-city-streets/\">San Francisco Examiner</a>.</p> <p>Brian Wiedenmeier, executive director of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition, also raised concerns about the vehicles in a <a href=\"https://www.sfbike.org/news/a-warning-to-people-who-bike-self-driving-ubers-and-right-hook-turns/\">blog post</a>. Wiedenmeier said that he had been invited to take a ride in a self-driving Uber prior to the launch and came away with deep concerns about the vehicles’ ability to operate safely in a city where cars share the road with bicyclists. </p> <p>“Those vehicles are not yet ready for our streets,” he wrote. </p> <p>San Francisco mayor Ed Lee, who is generally a strong ally of the city’s technology companies, “expressly warned” Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to remove the cars from the road in a telephone call Friday, according to the mayor’s press office.</p> <p>“Uber is failing to be a respectful civic partner to the city of San Francisco by choosing to put Uber’s self-interest before the safety of the residents of their home town,” Ellen Canale, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said in a statement.</p> <p>In a blogpost published Wednesday, Levandowski argued that whether the company needed a permit from the state was a matter of “debate”, adding that Uber had “looked at this issue carefully” and determined that a permit was not necessary since its cars would still have human drivers monitoring them. </p> <p>Levandowski also appeared to argue that the state of California, home to Silicon Valley, should amend its regulations to accommodate Uber, noting that other states had regulations that “made clear that they are pro-technology”.</p> <p>The conflict has exposed what critics say are the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/16/uber-self-driving-cars-california-illegal-unethical-tactics\">unethical and illegal tactics</a> that the company has consistently used to grow its business.

This is exactly the kind of thing that I would hope a company like Facebook would do in taking advantage of the very diligent effort being done by these professional fact-checking organizations,” said Lucas Graves, author of Deciding What’s True: The Rise of Political Fact-Checking in American Journalism.</p> <p>Facebook’s plan for combating fake news, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-fake-news-election-conspiracy-theories\">a response to mounting criticism over the spread of misinformation</a>, particularly during the US presidential election, is theoretically relatively simple. When enough users flag a news article they think is factually inaccurate, Facebook sends the link to a digital clearing house accessible to a handful of fact-checking organizations. </p> <p>Those organizations can choose which stories they would like to assess and, if their investigation deems the article to be a hoax or containing false information, it will be marked as “disputed” whenever it appears on the social network. It will also be deprioritized in Facebook’s news feed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e971342e412f7b12a9b541ea38508b6815c273d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e971342e412f7b12a9b541ea38508b6815c273d/0_0_2234_1887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Examples from Facebook of measures they are taking to curb the spread of fake news.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"845\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Examples from Facebook of measures they are taking to curb the spread of fake news.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the first articles to be sent by Facebook to its team of specially selected fact-checking organizations on Friday was <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/florida-seeking-full-recount-real-story/story?id=44224185\">an article by Bipartisan Report</a> that falsely claimed that Florida was holding an election recount over voter fraud. The story was deemed false by ABC News, one of Facebook’s fact-checkers. </p> <p>However, potential problems with the system are already emerging.</p> <p>The organizations tasked with policing Facebook’s content are not getting paid for their troubles. </p> <p>This could create a huge burden for some of the smaller organizations to make a dent on viral misinformation, particularly as each story has to be addressed individually. (Facebook will not apply the “disputed” flag across similar stories, even if they report the same hoax or misinformation.)<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/12/facebook-2016-problems-fake-news-censorship\">2016: the year Facebook became the bad guy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>FactCheck.org, for example, has a team of five full-time staff and five undergraduate students who each work 15 hours a week. “I’d like to say we could dedicate someone to this, but it depends on our resources. Facebook isn’t providing any funding for this, so we’ll fit it in along with other things we do,” said director Eugene Kiely.</p> <p>The process involved in establishing the veracity of stories is also complicated. Typically, Kiely’s organization fact-checks statements made by politicians, rather than news articles themselves.</p> <p>“Here the job is going to be labelling the story as reliable or not reliable, rather than an individual claim, and that’s going to require some adjustment by the fact-checkers,” Graves said.</p> <p>Better-resourced groups have allocated whole teams to the problem. ABC News said it had a team of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/technology/facebook-fact-checking-fake-news.html\">about six people dealing with fake news</a>, which means that the Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC News, is effectively subsidizing a solution to a problem faced by Facebook.</p> <p>This, despite the fact that Facebook is among the most valuable companies in the world, with a market cap of more than $340bn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mims/status/809461936979001344\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Facebook, a company that makes $7 billion in revenue every 3 months, is getting its fake news filter subsidized by Disney <a href=\"https://t.co/kMf25vNE5T\">pic.twitter.com/kMf25vNE5T</a></p>&mdash; Christopher Mims™ (@mims) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/status/809461936979001344\">December 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>“I think an ideal model would be one in which companies that really dominate the lion’s share of ad revenue, so companies like Facebook and Google, would direct some support to an independent fund, which would in turn be used to support third-party fact-checking,” Graves said.</p> <p>“We could use some money from Facebook or anyone else willing to help out,” added Kiely.</p> <p>The fact-checking organizations helping Facebook identify and flag fake news do, however, stand to benefit from the tool. If a Facebook reader wants to find out why a story has been labeled “disputed”, they can click on a link to an article by the fact-checking organization explaining the decision. This could mean a traffic boost to those sites.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/16/facebook-bias-bubble-us-election-conservative-liberal-news-feed\">Bursting the Facebook bubble: we asked voters on the left and right to swap feeds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another issue is that the system is currently built to flag only articles hosted by external sites. That means that videos, memes or <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/1998-trump-people-quote/\">photos</a> will be unaffected – even if they contain the very same false information or hoaxes. The Guardian understands that Facebook will, however, reassess this once they have tested the system with news articles.</p> <p>There is also the possibility that the system could be gamed by disgruntled Facebook users who could work together to flag factually accurate stories as “fake news” in order to clog up the fact-checking clearing house.</p> <p>This is a particular challenge given that some rightwing groups, which have a track record of corralling online activists, deem the fact-checking organizations to be biased against them. InfoWars, a rightwing website known to peddle conspiracies and fake news, has already declared that the partnership with Snopes “clearly opens the door for the outright censorship of conservative content and opinion”.</p> <p>Facebook said that it will have some ability to detect when someone is trying to spam the system with false flags and that it would only send news articles, and not personal blogposts, through to its volunteer fact checkers.</p> <p>“What Facebook is doing isn’t going to deal with the gray area. It’s looking at stuff that’s completely made up,” Kiely said.</p> <p>Nevertheless, he accepts that the facts won’t matter to some people. </p> <p>“President Trump goes around talking about the dishonest media and fact checkers and his supporters will trust what he’s saying and not what we’re saying,” he said.</p> <p>“If we are saying something counter to their beliefs then they are not going to accept it. We are not writing for those people but the larger chunk in the middle between the two sides [of the political fence].”</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p><strong>Is the UK’s 4G mobile phone coverage really worse than Romania, Albania and Peru, as a report suggested last week?<br /></strong>Yes and no. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/dec/14/uk-4g-coverage-worse-than-in-romania-and-peru-watchdog-finds\">report by the National Infrastructure Commission</a> used data on how much of the time a person’s mobile is connected to 4G. On that measure, the UK scores worse than 53 countries, many of which we might expect to have far worse mobile networks – not just Romania, Albania and Peru, but also Georgia, Latvia and Mexico. UK phones were connected to 4G barely half the time.</p> <p>But the rankings didn’t measure geographical coverage, ie where you can get a signal, or speeds, which will vary even on a solid 4G connection. According to the same researchers who produced the data on availability, the UK ranks 29th globally for average speed, and in terms of 4G coverage of where people live and work, in 2015 Ofcom put the UK ahead of all the EU’s largest economies except Germany.</p> <p><strong>So is there actually a problem?<br /></strong>Yes, because people are still spending a lot of time unable to get fast internet connections. The full NIC report cited figures showing that around 20% of buildings in cities and towns, and almost 80% of those in rural areas, don’t have 4G. Roads are also often “digital deserts”, with just 8% of A and B roads fully covered, and almost half having none at all.</p> <p><strong>Why isn’t the UK better at making sure I can get a good signal?<br /></strong>The report cites the UK’s comparatively late auction of the 4G spectrum – whereby mobile operators and networks bid for space on the airwaves used to carry calls, texts and data – as one of the reasons coverage isn’t up to scratch. While the US held its auction in 2008, the UK took until 2013 (though EE was allowed, controversially, to repurpose some of its spectrum earlier). One explanation for the delay was that the spectrum up for sale was previously in use by analogue TV services, which weren’t fully switched off until 2012.</p> <p>But while this did delay the 4G rollout, there are a range of other factors that have held back better coverage. The type of frequency band within the spectrum the operators have, and how they use it, is one. Lower-frequency bands, particularly under 1GHz, travel further and are better at penetrating buildings, while higher-frequency bands carry more data. The ideal situation for any mobile phone company (and its customers) is to have a range of bands so it can provide both wide coverage and fast speeds. However, the UK government has been criticised for not doing enough to make sure each operator got a large slice of lower-frequency bands.</p> <p><strong>So all we need to do is shift some frequency bands around?<br /></strong>Unfortunately not, because the other big issue for improving coverage is even more thorny – the UK’s planning laws.</p> <p>The closer to a mobile mast you are, the better and more reliable your connection, and the more masts an operator has, the better the coverage they can offer. But rules such as how high a mast can be, and where it can be built, make life difficult for operators and the companies they pay to manage their network.</p> <p>Add in local concerns about the (unproven) health impacts of living near a mast, and occasionally belligerent landowners charging fees for access or denying it altogether, and the process of putting up more masts can be lengthy and costly.</p> <p><strong>Will 5G</strong> <strong>solve the problem?<br /></strong>Not really. 5G, which will be rolled out after 2020, will make mobile data connections faster – probably much faster. But similar limitations imposed by what frequency bands it travels over, and where the masts are, will apply. As the NIC’s chair, Andrew Adonis, said about the 5G rollout when the report was released, “none of this will matter unless we bring our mobile network up to speed”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/14/poor-mobile-4g-coverage-peru-minister-internet-government\">UK 4G coverage is worse than in Peru. We need a minister for the internet | Charles Arthur</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>So what needs to be done to make sure I get better mobile signal?<br /></strong>Things are already set to improve in coming years. More of the low-frequency spectrum that is good at providing wider coverage is being used, and the EU’s recent freeing up of some of the 700MHz band currently used for digital TV is likely to help further.</p> <p>Ofcom has set a target that all indoor premises will have more than 98% 4G coverage by end of 2017, from at least one mobile network (though there are doubts about whether that will be achieved), and the NIC has recommended universal service obligation for operators for no later than 2025. How Ofcom handles the 5G auction, and the distribution of frequency bands, could also make a difference.</p> <p>Planning issues are likely to be tougher to deal with and in some cases that will mean people deciding which they value more, the video on their smartphone or the view out of their window.</p>',\n",

It gained the highest score of A+. </p> <p>The Guardian, rated as A- along with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/\">TechCrunch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/\">ProPublica</a>, scored highly for having a valid HTTPS version of its website, and for defaulting to that connection for all visitors.</p> <p>The ranking also awarded points for enabling HSTS (<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security\">HTTP Strict-Transport-Security</a>), a feature which ensures that repeat visitors cannot be forced onto an insecure copy of the website by a “man in the middle” attacker. With HSTS enabled, web browsers know to never accept insecure versions of the website, providing added protection to readers who fear eavesdropping.</p> <p>The Intercept was the only site to use HSTS preloading which give it its A+ score. Preloading involves passing the HSTS information to a trusted authority like Google or Mozilla so that it can be loaded into the browsers of web users who have never even visited a particular site, ensuring that even their very first visit does not run the risk of eavesdropping.</p> <p>Freedom of the Press Foundation said that only 28% of news sites offer an HTTPS connection, and just 14% default to it. It awarded a grade of F to those that did not use HTTPS. The Guardian’s switch to HTTPS as default <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2016/nov/29/the-guardian-has-moved-to-https\">was made in late November</a>, after six months of testing to ensure no disruption to readers.</p> <p>“By using HTTPS, internet service providers (ISPs) <a href=\"https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/ISPsAreThreats\">are not able to track</a> the pages our readers are accessing,” wrote Mariot Chauvin and Huma Islam, two members of the Guardian’s digital development team. “It means we protect the privacy of our readers when accessing content that may disclose political opinions, faith, sexual orientation or any information that may be used against them. It matches our core values. We believe that protecting our visitors is good internet citizenship.”</p> <p>The Freedom of the Press Foundation called on all publications to protect reader privacy: “With HTTPS enabled by default you can protect reader privacy, improve your website’s security, better protect your sources, prevent censorship, improve your search rankings, provide a better user experience, see your website loading speeds potentially increase, and avoid Google shaming.” Since 2014, Google has been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html\">ranking secure sites</a> slightly higher in its search results.</p>',\n",

This has led some researchers to study Google’s role in the presidential election in the same way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-fake-news-election-conspiracy-theories\">that they have scrutinized Facebook</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94e4295e7f464a9d5439d98b3c8b5b3fe046f2d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94e4295e7f464a9d5439d98b3c8b5b3fe046f2d6/0_0_795_178/500.jpg\" alt=\"Google abortion\" width=\"500\" height=\"112\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a7109b099a69d7ba6ecc688c91ce0cc4a261655\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a7109b099a69d7ba6ecc688c91ce0cc4a261655/0_0_803_358/500.jpg\" alt=\"Google abortion\" width=\"500\" height=\"223\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Robert Epstein from the <a href=\"http://aibrt.org/\">American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology</a> has spent four years trying to reverse engineer Google’s search algorithms. He believes, based on systematic research, that Google has the power to rig elections through something he calls the search engine manipulation effect (SEME).<br /></p> <p>Epstein conducted five experiments in two countries to find that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/how-google-could-rig-the-2016-election-121548_Page2.html#.WFHJ6KIrJ-U\">biased rankings in search results can shift the opinions of undecided voters</a>. If Google tweaks its algorithm to show more positive search results for a candidate, the searcher may form a more positive opinion of that candidate.</p> <p>In September 2016, Epstein released findings, <a href=\"https://sputniknews.com/us/201609121045214398-google-clinton-manipulation-election/\">published through Russian news agency Sputnik News, that indicated Google</a> had suppressed negative autocomplete search results relating to Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>“We know that if there’s a negative autocomplete suggestion in the list, it will draw somewhere between five and 15 times as many clicks as a neutral suggestion,” Epstein said. “If you omit negatives for one perspective, one hotel chain or one candidate, you have a heck of a lot of people who are going to see only positive things for whatever the perspective you are supporting.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"037bc7df8c0b592582566c5c52484c6ebe047f02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/037bc7df8c0b592582566c5c52484c6ebe047f02/0_0_751_160/500.jpg\" alt=\"google sandy hook\" width=\"500\" height=\"107\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91a2f02a863d7d5ee01163788261a9fd97d4faa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91a2f02a863d7d5ee01163788261a9fd97d4faa5/0_0_794_211/500.jpg\" alt=\"googlehomosexuality\" width=\"500\" height=\"133\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Even changing the order in which certain search terms appear in the autocompleted list can make a huge impact, with the first result drawing the most clicks, he said.</p> <p>At the time, Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-autocomplete/\">said the autocomplete algorithm</a> was designed to omit disparaging or offensive terms associated with individuals’ names but that it wasn’t an “exact science”. </p> <p>Then there’s the secret recipe of factors that feed into the algorithm Google uses to determine a web page’s importance – embedded with the biases of the humans who programmed it. These factors include how many and which other websites link to a page, how much traffic it receives, and how often a page is updated. People who are very active politically are typically the most partisan, which means that extremist views peddled actively on blogs and fringe media sites get elevated in the search ranking. </p> <p>“These platforms are structured in such a way that they are allowing and enabling – consciously or unconsciously – more extreme views to dominate,” said Martin Moore from Kings College London’s Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and Power. </p> <p>Appearing on the first page of Google search results can give websites with questionable editorial principles undue authority and traffic.</p> <p>“These two manipulations can work together to have an enormous impact on people without their knowledge that they are being manipulated, and our research shows that very clearly,” Epstein said. “Virtually no one is aware of bias in search suggestions or rankings.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These manipulations can work together to have enormous impact on people without knowledge that they\\'re being manipulated</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Epstein</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is compounded by Google’s personalization of search results, which means different users see different results based on their interests. “This gives companies like Google even more power to influence people’s opinions, attitudes, beliefs and behaviors,” he said.</p> <p>Epstein wants Google to be more transparent about how and when it manually manipulates the algorithm.</p> <p>“They are constantly making these adjustments. It’s absurd for them to say everything is automated,” he said. Manual removals from autocomplete include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/05/google-alters-search-autocomplete-remove-are-jews-evil-suggestion\">“are jews evil” and “are women evil”</a>. Google has also altered its results so when someone searches for ways to kill themselves <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/05/technology/05google.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss\">they are shown a suicide helpline</a>.</p> <p>Shortly after Epstein released his research indicating the suppression of negative autocomplete search results relating to Clinton, which he credits to close ties <a href=\"http://qz.com/823922/eric-schmidt-played-a-crucial-role-in-team-hillarys-election-tech/\">between the Clinton campaign and Google</a>, the search engine appeared to pull back from such censorship, he said. This, he argued, allowed for a flood of pro-Trump, anti-Clinton content (including fake news), some of which was created in retaliation to bubble to the top. </p> <p>“If I had to do it over again I would not have released those data. There is some indication that they had an impact that was detrimental to Hillary Clinton, which was never my intention.”</p> <p>Rhea Drysdale, the CEO of digital marketing company <a href=\"http://outspokenmedia.com/\">Outspoken Media</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@rhea/hillary-clintons-search-results-manipulated-by-sourcefed-not-google-3dd9a5c68ca1\">did not see evidence</a> of pro-Clinton editing by Google. However, she did note networks of partisan websites – disproportionately rightwing – using much better search engine optimization techniques to ensure their worldview ranked highly. </p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/05/google-must-review-its-search-rankings-because-of-rightwing-manipulation\">tech-savvy rightwing groups organized online</a> and developed creative ways to control and manipulate social media conversations through mass actions, said Shane Burley, a journalist and researcher who has studied the “alt-right”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65e35973621fe379228acdb78017c05cf31b9927\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65e35973621fe379228acdb78017c05cf31b9927/0_0_822_192/500.jpg\" alt=\"google alt-right\" width=\"500\" height=\"117\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>“What happens is they can essentially jam hashtags so densely using multiple accounts, they end up making it trending,” he said. “That’s a great way for them to dictate how something is going to be covered, what’s going to be discussed. That’s helped them reframe the discussion of immigration.”</p> <p>Burley noted that “cuckservative” – meaning conservatives who have sold out – is a good example of a term that the “alt-right” has managed to popularize in an effective way. Similarly if you search for “feminism is ...” in Google, it autocompletes to “feminism is cancer”, a popular rallying cry for Trump supporters. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They can essentially jam hashtags so densely using multiple accounts, they end up making it trending\\u200b\\u200b</p> <footer> <cite>Shane Burley</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“It has this effect of making certain words kind of like magic words in search algorithms.”</p> <p>The same groups – including members of the popular “alt-right” Reddit forum The_Donald – used techniques that are used by reputation management firms and marketers to push their companies up Google’s search results, to ensure <a href=\"https://edgylabs.com/2016/12/09/google-search-engine-influenced-reddit/\">pro-Trump imagery and articles ranked highly</a>.</p> <p>“Extremists have been trying to play Google’s algorithm for years, with varying degrees of success,” said Brittan Heller, director of technology and society at the Anti-Defamation League. “The key has traditionally been connected to influencing the algorithm with a high volume of biased search terms.”</p> <p> The problem has become particularly challenging for Google in a post-truth era, where white supremacist websites may have the same indicator of “trustworthiness” in the eyes of Google as other websites high in the page rank.</p> <p>“What does Google do when the lies aren’t the outliers any more?” Heller said.<br /></p> <p>“Previously there was the assumption that everything on the internet had a glimmer of truth about it. With the phenomenon of fake news and media hacking, that may be changing.”</p> <p>A Google spokeswoman said in a statement: “We’ve received a lot of questions about autocomplete, and we want to help people understand how it works: Autocomplete predictions are algorithmically generated based on users’ search activity and interests. Users search for such a wide range of material on the web – 15% of searches we see every day are new. Because of this, terms that appear in Autocomplete may be unexpected or unpleasant. We do our best to prevent offensive terms, like porn and hate speech, from appearing, but we don’t always get it right. Autocomplete isn’t an exact science and we’re always working to improve our algorithms.”</p>',\n",

This bold deflection of blame further highlights the corporation’s refusal to take responsibility for potential faults in its technology and raises questions about the dangers of prematurely rolling out self-driving vehicles.<br /></p> <p>“How many people are they going to kill before they understand they’re not doing the right thing?” said John M Simpson, privacy project director with Consumer Watchdog, a non-profit that has called for Uber to face consequences for side-stepping regulations. “If you’re going to use public highways as your own private laboratory, you’ve got an obligation to follow the rules.” </p> <p>Uber’s open defiance of California regulators marks the latest case of a “sharing economy” corporation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/apr/18/uber-airbnb-sharing-economy-tougher-rules-australia\">ignoring government</a> under the guise of “disruption” and “innovation”. Uber has long claimed that it is a technology “platform” and not a transportation company and thus does not have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/21/uber-driver-settlement-labor-dispute-california-massachusetts\">classify its drivers as employees</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/04/uber-challenged-taxi-too-late-to-regulate-it\">follow traditional taxicab regulations</a>. </p> <p>That strategy has resulted in <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/07/04/uber-battling-more-than-70-lawsuits-in-federal-courts/\">more than 70 lawsuits</a> in federal courts and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/13/uber-lawsuits-619-million-ride-hailing-app\">hefty settlements</a>, along with claims from opponents that the company is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/23/uber-drivers-union-settlement-contractors\">abusing workers’ rights</a> and failing to ensure the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/10/uber-pledges-improve-vetting-drivers-dallas-assault\">safety of riders</a>. </p> <p>The San Francisco self-driving car scandal centers on Uber’s Volvo XC90s, which can <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/technology/2016/sep/26/uber-self-driving-passengers-pittsburgh-injury-death-waiver\">navigate on their own</a> while licensed drivers sit at the wheel and take control when necessary.

That’s how people are protected.” </p> <p>In the long term, he added, “I am concerned self-driving cars are going to put a lot of people out of work.” </p> <p>One San Francisco Uber driver, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, followed a self-driving car for about 15 minutes on Wednesday and filmed its movements. The footage shows multiple minor violations or potentially dangerous moves, such as failing to fully brake at a stop sign or cutting off a bus. </p> <p>“I’d expect better behavior from a company with such clout in the transportation industry,” he said. </p> <p>Uber has <a href=\"https://newsroom.uber.com/san-francisco-your-self-driving-uber-is-arriving-now/\">argued</a> that it does not need permits since its cars aren’t fully autonomous, though the DMV noted that 20 companies have followed proper procedures and were approved to test self-driving vehicles in California.</p> <p>Uber did not respond to repeated inquiries about the state’s order and lawsuit threat. In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson claimed that two cars running red lights were not part of the pilot and weren’t carrying customers. </p> <p>“These incidents were due to human error. This is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building self-driving Ubers.” A spokesperson also claimed the cars require “human monitoring and intervention in many conditions, including bad weather”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8106da18bc1c0434aae27852b093f877bd41e6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8106da18bc1c0434aae27852b093f877bd41e6a/0_78_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Uber driverless car is displayed in a garage in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Uber driverless car is displayed in a garage in San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Experts note that Uber has an obvious financial interest in a system with minimal regulations. By ignoring California regulators, the corporation is attempting to preemptively create a framework in which self-driving cars are treated similarly to traditional vehicles, said Arun Sundararajan, a New York University business professor and expert on the sharing economy.<br /></p> <p>“The act of asking for permission is sort of a tacit admission that this needs to be regulated,” he said. “They are playing a long game here … They’re trying to define what the regulatory space is going to look like.” </p> <p>Michael Gumora, a longtime San Francisco Uber driver who runs a website called <a href=\"http://www.ridesharereport.com/\">RideshareReport.com</a>, said it was a public relations ploy to announce suspensions and say the drivers erred when the automation system clearly didn’t work properly. </p> <p>“It’s a human error, but the vehicle and the technology didn’t compensate,” he said. “The technology itself wasn’t able to avoid running the red light.” </p> <p>Taborek said publicly admonishing the operators was another example of Uber mistreating drivers. “I would take anything Uber says with massive grains of salt ... I’d be willing to bet good money that the technology is at fault.”</p> <p>Uber’s response is reminiscent of statements from Tesla earlier this year after a driver <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk\">using its “autopilot” technology</a> died in a crash. The corporation denied responsibility and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/01/tesla-driver-killed-autopilot-self-driving-car-harry-potter\">defended its technology</a> even though the car’s system <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/02/elon-musk-self-driving-tesla-autopilot-joshua-brown-risks\">failed to detect a truck</a> in front of it. </p> <p>“You put unsafe vehicles on the road and then you blame a human,” said Simpson, who argued that San Francisco police should respond to Uber’s rogue operations by impounding the vehicles operating without a permit. </p> <p>Consumer Watchdog also called for criminal charges against Uber’s CEO Travis Kalanick for violating DMV requirements. </p> <p>“This is essentially driving without a license,” Simpson said. “It’s really unconscionable.” </p> <p>Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Completely wireless earbuds are the future of in-ear music, freeing us from the shackles of cables even between the ears. But while many have tried to make wireless earbuds that work, very few actually do. Others haven’t even got theirs to market yet, with even Apple being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/26/apple-airpods-wireless-earbuds-delay-launch\">forced to delay its AirPods</a> for six weeks.</p> <p> </p> <p>The big problem with those that do exist is most cannot maintain a solid connection between themselveswhile on opposite sides of your head. To complicate things, smartphones are not all born equally for Bluetooth performance.</p> <p>To conduct the test I used a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/27/google-pixel-xl-review-phablet-price-smartphone-camera-android-71-nougat\">Google Pixel XL</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/11/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-review-android-smartphone-phablet-marshmallow\">Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/iphone-7-review-poor-battery-life\">Apple iPhone 7</a> and tried as many earbuds as I could get my hands on, finally finding only two worth buying.</p> <h2><em>Here are the ones to avoid, and why ...</em></h2> <h2>Earin</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2c2875b25841dea0c6e67590903f844cfd515ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2c2875b25841dea0c6e67590903f844cfd515ec/0_0_4438_2663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"earin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Earin were some of the first on the market and are still one of the most comfortable, but just aren’t reliable enough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Price:</strong> £199</p> <p>Earin look like old school car cigarette lighters shrunk so they can fit in your ear.

They stick out further than most, but were comfortable, lasting a couple of hours between trips in the rotating charging case.</p> <p>They were fine when out running connected to a smartwatch, and worked better than some others, but still struggled to maintain a connection between the left and right earbuds when walking in town, in the office or the train station.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> OK for running, but frustrating for commuting</p> <h2>PK K’asq</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13284ce61b15d8c7eb2a6ef76af628ea9e1f9c9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13284ce61b15d8c7eb2a6ef76af628ea9e1f9c9b/0_0_4438_2663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"PK K’asq\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you want to look like a minicab driver, the PK K’asq are the ones you want.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Price:</strong> £116.62<br /></p> <p>If you want to look like you’re a taxi driver, but with a Bluetooth headset in each ear, the PK K’asq are for you.

They were a combination between earbud and fitness tracker that failed to live up to expectations.</p> <p>Now the new Bragi the Headphone – stupid name as they’re earbuds not headphones – aims to simplify things and fix the problems that held back the Dash and so many others like it: connection reliability.</p> <p>The earphones are kidney-shaped with an earbud sticking out like an old gramophone horn, which blasts the sound down your earhole and keeps them in place. They’re light and nothing else of the earbuds has to touch your ears and you can wear them in multiple orientations making them the most comfortable wireless earbuds I’ve tried.</p> <p>The right earbud has three buttons. The bottom one is the power button – hold for three seconds to turn them on or off – as well as the play, pause and skip-track button. The left and right buttons adjust volume and switch ambient noise on and off, which pipes the sounds of the environment around you into your ear using the microphones built into the earbuds. The buttons are a bit stiff, but it’s not too difficult to grab the back of the bud with your finger when you press them to save your ear canals.</p> <p>They sound pretty good, once you get the fit right with the tips – they come with three, but only the comply foam ones did the job for me – and are comfortable to wear for extended periods. They do not sound as good as a £125 pair of wired earbuds, but they’re balanced, with decent separation, mids and highs. Those looking for thunderous bass are out of luck and you have to put up with a small hiss sound in the background when they’re active.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"628086ad33a9ba68ded460d74c960b333bfcd639\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/628086ad33a9ba68ded460d74c960b333bfcd639/0_91_1440_864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"bragi the headphone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Headphone earbuds slot into the case ready for charging, but do not contain a battery for on-the-go charging.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bragi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bragi reckons they’ll last for six hours between charges. They lasted more like five in my testing. The case doesn’t have a battery, which means you need to plug it in to charge your earbuds, but is has the plus of being able to completely turn off the Headphone meaning they’ll still have charge when you come back to them after a long weekend or so.</p> <p>But they have one winning feature that sets them apart from almost all the others: rock-solid connectivity with all smartphones in the group.</p> <p>Whether it’s to your smartphone or between themselves, the Headphone simply work where others do not. In the office, on the train, on the underground, on a bus, walking down the street or through a train station, they kept their connection and the music flowing.</p> <p>Call quality, although only in mono through the right earbud, was excellent and the recipient could hear me just fine.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> simple, good-sounding, comfortable and work, making them worth buying</p> <h2>Jabra Elite Sport</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6b74b2e29906a1b789aff4bc850897a313e467b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6b74b2e29906a1b789aff4bc850897a313e467b/0_0_4438_2663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"jabra elite sport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rock-solid connection and ear-conforming shape mean the Jabra Elite Sport bluetooth earbuds are a worthy contender.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Price:</strong> £229<br /></p> <p>Jabra have a long history of making good but not overly popular Bluetooth headphones. The Elite are the company’s first wireless earbuds and while they’re relatively late to the game, they’re worth waiting for.</p> <p>Unlike the Bragi, the Elite earbuds fill the ear like a canal shell hearing aid. The bottom bit, which has a heart rate sensor in it in the right earbud, fits against your antitragus and the top bit the lower crural of the antihelix, holding the earbuds securely in place while the tip fits into your ear canal.</p> <p>They come with three sizes of wing and three different sizes of earbud in two materials, but I found the smallest wings to completely fill my outer ear. The right felt a little uncomfortable at first, but settled down. The left ear is obviously a slightly different shape as the top part of the earbud constantly caused pain with the smallest wing.</p> <p>The Elite’s connection both between each bud and to any of the smartphones was rock solid with no interruptions under any of the conditions I tested. They sound pretty good, with more bass than the Bragi, although slightly less balance and separation in the rest of the range. They also blocked out more ambient noise, but still made a small hiss sound when active in the ear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6e113c8c718e0b8d07b53125442754b248f5bb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6e113c8c718e0b8d07b53125442754b248f5bb3/0_0_2280_1368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"jabra elite sport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Elite Sport earbuds clip into the small battery case for storage and charging.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jabra</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each earbud has two buttons and two microphones. The right earbud controls pause, play and starts exercise tracking. Double pressing the play button also activates ambient sound. The left earbud has volume control buttons, which you hold for a second to skip track.</p> <p>They last for about three hours and come with a compact battery case that will charge them twice.</p> <p>The buds can track heart rate, fed to the Jabra Sport Life app, and provide audio guidance for workouts, runs, races and recovery sessions, using the GPS from your phone to track your pace.</p> <p>Call quality was good and in stereo, but the recipient couldn’t hear me quite as clearly as with the Bragi.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> larger size could make them less comfortable, but they have rock-solid connection, good sound and added fitness features</p> <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/05/five-of-the-best-bluetooth-headphones-to-break-free-of-cables\">Five of the best Bluetooth headphones to break free of cables</a><br /></strong></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/08/optoma-nuforce-be6-review-bluetooth-earbuds-worth-buying\"><strong>Optoma NuForce BE6 review: Bluetooth earbuds worth buying</strong></a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/04/plantronics-backbeat-sense-review-light-long-lasting-great-sounding-bluetooth-headphones\"><strong>Plantronics BackBeat Sense review: light, long-lasting and great sounding Bluetooth headphones</strong></a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/15/marshall-major-ii-bluetooth-headphones-battery-life-sound-wireless\"><strong>Marshall Major II Bluetooth headphones: they last for ages and sound great too</strong></a></li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/21/bose-qc35-wireless-bluetooth-noise-cancelling-headphones-review\">Bose QC35 wireless headphones: simply unrivalled noise cancelling</a></strong></li> </ul>',\n",

What counts is what you pay for and what you get.”</p> <p>IA has been calling for the NBN to dump the fibre-to-the-node rollout in favour of the “fibre-to-the-home” approach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/20/nbn-the-trouble-with-coalitions-plan-for-quicker-and-cheaper-broadband\">initially committed to by Kevin Rudd’s government</a> before being watered down by the Abbott-led government.</p> <p>The annual cost to the federal budget of the government’s investment in the NBN is expected to grow in coming years.</p> <p>A report by the Parliamentary Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/14/annual-cost-of-nbn-to-rise-to-21bn-by-2017-says-budget-office\">released on Wednesday</a> estimated the cost to the budget in 2016-17 to be about $580m.</p>',\n",

The industry groups lost the lawsuit in June.</p> <p>Wheeler was met with suspicion when president Barack Obama first appointed him. Comedian John Oliver said Obama’s choice was “the equivalent of needing a babysitter and hiring a dingo” and encouraged viewers to flood the FCC’s system with pro-net neutrality comments. Wheeler himself was taken aback when the comments came at such a volume that they crashed the comments system. “I would like to state for the record that I am not a dingo,” he said when pressed by a reporter over the incident.</p> <p>Indeed, Wheeler has been instrumental in changing the industry to accommodate new players and to vex the establishment he once represented. “My history has always been working with the insurgent, not the incumbent,” he told Ars Technica last year.</p>',\n",

The ACLU’s records prompted the companies to <a href=\"http://www.aclunc.org/docs/20161212_twitter_letter_to_aclu.pdf\">announce</a> that Dataminr had terminated access for all fusion centers and would no longer provide social media surveillance tools to any local, state or federal government entities. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/aclu-geofeedia-facebook-twitter-instagram-black-lives-matter\">ACLU finds social media sites gave data to company tracking black protesters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/29/fbi-coordinated-crackdown-occupy\">government centers</a> are partnerships between agencies that work to collect vast amounts of information purportedly to analyze “threats”. The spy centers, according to the ACLU, target protesters, journalists and others protected by free speech rights while also <a href=\"https://www.aclunc.org/our-work/legal-docket/gill-v-doj-challenge-federal-suspicious-activity-reporting\">racially profiling</a> people deemed “suspicious” by law enforcement.</p> <p>“These are massive hubs for information collection and monitoring and surveillance of individuals,” said Nicole Ozer, technology and civil liberties policy director at the ACLU of California. “The information they collect is often about innocent people.” </p> <p>The revelations about the potential collaboration between the government centers and private technology companies are particularly alarming given heightened concerns about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/17/muslim-americans-donald-trump-hate-crimes-surveillance\">mass surveillance under President-elect Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.aclunc.org/docs/20160315_dataminr_email_to_jric.pdf\">Records</a> that the ACLU obtained uncovered that a <a href=\"https://www.jric.org/?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1\">fusion center</a> in southern California had access to Dataminr’s “geospatial analysis application”, which allowed the government to do location-based tracking as well as searches tied to keywords. That means the center could use Dataminr to search billions of tweets and monitor specific demographics or organizations. </p> <p>In one email, Dataminr told Los Angeles police that its product could be customized to track protests, adding: “Twitter owns part of Dataminr (5%) so our access to their data is unmatched – no other company ingests the full firehouse of 500 million tweets in real-time … Twitter has been very clear with my CEO: ‘Dataminr is the only company with full, unrestricted access.’”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These are massive hubs for information collection … The information they collect is often about innocent people</p> <footer> <cite>Nicole Ozer, ACLU of California</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A <a href=\"http://www.aclunc.org/docs/20161215_dataminr_geospatial_analysis_app_brochure.pdf\">Dataminr brochure</a> touted the use of the company’s geospatial analysis application to monitor a student demonstration in South Africa by tracking hashtags and keywords. </p> <p>Although Twitter has since cut off the spy centers’ access, some have argued that social media companies should have had stronger protections in place so that this kind of partnership and data sharing doesn’t happen in the first place.</p> <p>By giving government agencies access to these tools, Dataminr was also clearly violating <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/2016/developer-policies-to-protect-people-s-voices-on-twitter\">Twitter’s policy</a> prohibiting the use of its data for surveillance, according to the ACLU. </p> <p>“It’s really even more important now than ever that the companies have strong policies in place and that they have the right auditing and enforcement to make sure those rules are followed,” Ozer said.</p> <p>In October, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/aclu-geofeedia-facebook-twitter-instagram-black-lives-matter\">ACLU obtained government records</a> revealing that Twitter, Facebook and Instagram had provided users’ data to Geofeedia, a software company that aids police surveillance programs and has targeted protesters of color. The revelations prompted all three companies to remove access to certain data streams. </p> <p>In the spring, Twitter also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/09/twitter-surveillance-fbi-cia-privacy-dataminr\">blocked US national security agencies</a>, including the FBI and CIA, from buying bulk data on its users from Dataminr. </p> <p>The announcement on Thursday applies to all <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/fusion-center-locations-and-contact-information\">77 fusion centers</a> in the US. Ozer said she hoped other companies would follow suit, noting that Dataminr’s technology “is probably not the only type of tool that fusion centers may have access to. It’s really important for other companies to be taking action to protect their users.” </p> <p>Spokespeople for Twitter and Dataminr pointed to their <a href=\"http://www.aclunc.org/docs/20161212_twitter_letter_to_aclu.pdf\">letter to the ACLU</a> this week, which noted that Dataminr only received public Twitter data. The letter also said Dataminr had “refined” its product for public sectors, focusing on a “breaking news alert” that helps first responders learn about events as quickly as possible.</p> <p>“Dataminr is committed to privacy and civil liberties protections,” the company said in a statement. “We have worked closely with Twitter to modify our product and incorporate feedback that ensures the strongest safeguards are in place for people who use Twitter.”</p>',\n",

On Wednesday evening, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-15/stolen-yahoo-data-includes-government-employee-information\">Bloomberg reported</a> that the victims of the billion-user hack include FBI, CIA, NSA and White House workers.</p> <p>Virginia senator Mark Warner joined technical analysts in expressing disappointment in the company. “This most-recent revelation warrants a separate follow-up and I plan to press the company on why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users,” Warner wrote in a statement.</p> <p>Some experts have questioned Yahoo’s claim that the attack was “state-sponsored”; Michael Mimoso of security firm Kaspersky Lab <a href=\"https://threatpost.com/yahoo-challenged-on-claims-breach-was-state-sponsored-attack/120975/\">suggested</a> “a criminal operation was behind the attack and sold the data to an eastern European government”, resulting in the confusion. </p> <p>Security researcher Brian Krebs said Yahoo’s security was especially bad “because of pseudo-security features (like secret questions) that tend to end up weakening the security of accounts”, and <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/12/yahoo-one-billion-more-accounts-hacked/\">recommended users stay away</a> from the company.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/27/yahoo-leak-500-million-accounts-senate\">Six US senators demanded Yahoo explain</a> exactly when it had detected the theft of user data in a letter to the company after the September revelations; the company did not comply in its response. In its November quarterly results report, though, Yahoo hinted that there was worse to come: “On November 7, 2016, law enforcement authorities began sharing certain data that they indicated was provided by a hacker who claimed the information was Yahoo user account data,” company spokespeople told investors.</p> <p>Yahoo now believes the hackers stole proprietary code from the company and used it to build falsified “session cookies” – bits of code that tell Yahoo’s servers that a computer has already logged in, so that users don’t have to keep entering passwords every time they open a new window. With the “forged cookies”, as Yahoo chief information security officer put it on the company blog, the hackers could peer into emails without a password.<br /></p> <p>US telecoms giant Verizon has signed a deal to acquire Yahoo for $4.85bn. Citing “people familiar with the matter”, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-15/verizon-said-to-explore-lower-price-or-even-exit-from-yahoo-deal\">Bloomberg reported</a> in the wake of the historic data breach that Verizon now wants either a steep discount or to abandon the deal altogether. Shares of Yahoo fell 6.5% on the news.</p> <p>Yahoo’s woes continued as Germany’s cybersecurity authority, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), advised German consumers to consider switching to safer alternatives for email, and criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt modern encryption techniques to protect users’ personal data.</p> <p>“Considering the repeated cases of data theft, users should look more closely at which services they want to use in the future and security should play a part in that decision,” the BSI’s president, Arne Schoenbohm, said in a statement.<br /></p> <p>The company’s legal situation may worsen: In response to Yahoo’s revelations in September, 23 consumer class action lawsuits have been filed against the firm in US federal and state courts. The lawsuit tally is from a filing with the US securities and exchange commission in November, over a month before Yahoo’s 500m-user breach became only the second-biggest-ever hack.<br /></p>',\n",

As a result of that and of how the media covered my call, I have received very explicit death threats. I have been called a traitor and a Muslim lover.</p> <p>“On Friday, an individual went through every one of my YouTube videos and said he would not rest until I was murdered. If that is not evidence that Britain First should be proscribed as a terrorist organisation, I am not sure what is.”<br /></p> <p>Haigh, who at 29 is the youngest Labour MP in the House of Commons, said she was disappointed with the initial reaction from police when she reported the abuse.</p> <p>She said she first told a special police unit situated in parliament designed to deal with such investigations. “Their reaction was: ‘South Yorkshire police need to deal with this.’ We reported it to SYP and the initial reaction was pretty dismissive: ‘It is really difficult to find people on the internet.’” </p> <p>The MP said SYP only seemed to start actively investigating after she told the media about the threats, though they were quick to install panic alarms in her Sheffield home and office, and to provide her with uniformed and undercover protection while going about constituency business over the weekend. The force has now put in a request to Google for IP information, she said.</p> <p>“I didn’t think they were going to act until the media attention. I don’t know what it would take to make them act. The same group [Britain First] inspired the murder of Jo, one force over [the border in West Yorkshire],” she said.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/18/vile-online-abuse-against-women-mps-needs-to-be-challenged-now\">Vile online abuse against female MPs ‘needs to be challenged now’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Haigh said she shrugged off the threats at first. She said: “My initial reaction was to treat it as fairly usual: I get really abusive messages all the time. But reflecting on how obsessive the individual seemed, and the specific obvious threats of murdering me, it did really affect me. I didn’t really feel safe until I came down to London on Monday.</p> <p>“SYP was really good at offering resources to protect me, had cars following me at roving surgery and undercover police at events. But I would really rather they put resources into investigating.”</p> <p>Following the parliamentary debate, Ben Wallace, the minister of state for security at the Home Office, said he would intervene, Haigh said.</p> <p>Being abused was now part and parcel of life as a female politician in the UK, she said. “For women it’s definitely depressingly familiar,” she said. “Speaking to male colleagues they just don’t seem to receive the same level or magnitude of abuse I get on a fairly regular basis. But it’s nothing compared with some colleagues, like Jess Phillips [MP for Birmingham Yardley]. I know Tracy Brabin has had horrific levels. We do become accustomed to it and we shouldn’t. I worry that it will put some women off coming into politics.”</p> <p>Brabin told the Guardian she had received abuse on social media in response to her efforts to champion diversity in her constituency of Batley and Spen and had asked the members of her local Labour party to respond by retweeting the positive things on her Twitter page. She has also had abuse by post, which one of her researchers has spoken to the police in the House of Commons about.</p> <p>Brabin said she would support her fellow female MPs however they chose to respond to such abuse, but she was trying not to let any of it get to her and had not made formal complaints to the police. “Everybody deals with it in their own way, but I particularly cannot afford to let it affect what I do because I wouldn’t get out of bed,” she said.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>A spokeswoman for South Yorkshire police confirmed that the force received a report of malicious communication in the early hours of 9 December. She said: “The force takes reports of this nature extremely seriously and inquiries are ongoing in relation to this matter.”</p>',\n",

It has promised to hand over another £40m if the company hits performance targets.</p> <p>“Through this transaction, we would extend our market presence in the UK and sustain high levels of growth given the considerable opportunity in this market,” said Just Eat’s chief executive, David Buttress.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/17/just-eat-flotation-online-takeaway\">Just Eat, which listed in 2014</a>, earns commission on restaurant orders placed via its website and apps.

Just Eat said Hungry House would generate topline operating profits of £12m to £15m in 2017 excluding exceptional integration costs of about £1m.</p> <p>The Hungry House deal will have to be cleared by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). After initially touching a new high of 623.5p Just Eat shares were down more than 1% at 591.5p by lunchtime.</p> <p>The Jefferies analyst David Reynolds said consolidation was a good thing for online marketplace models, with the purchase of Hungry House removing the possibility of the rival combining with the likes of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/deliveroo\">Deliveroo</a>. </p> <p>“While it may be some time before the CMA bless this deal, the strategic imperative for Just Eat makes sense,” said Reynolds. “We do not underestimate the importance of Just Eat taking Hungry House off the table.”</p> <p>Separately Just Eat announced the acquisition of the fast-growing Canadian outfit SkipTheDishes in a cash and shares deal worth CAD$110m (£66.1m). The business, which has 350,000 customers, is expected to have sales of CAD$23.5m in 2016. It handled 1.6m orders in the 10 months to October, which was up 186% year on year.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Experts have attacked Yahoo’s weak security after the revelation it suffered a hack in 2013, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/14/yahoo-hack-security-of-one-billion-accounts-breached\">which exposed the personal data of 1 billion users</a>, just months after revealing a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/22/yahoo-hack-data-state-sponsored\">500-million-user data breach</a> from 2014.</p> <p>The hack saw the potential theft of login details, personal details and any confidential or sensitive information contained within email correspondences. Yahoo provided the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/bt-broadband-yahoo-hack\">email services for BT and Sky customers</a>, as well as other services.</p> <p>Bruce Schneier, a cryptologist and one of the world’s most respected security experts, said: “Yahoo badly screwed up. They weren’t taking security seriously and that’s now very clear. I would have trouble trusting Yahoo going forward.”</p> <p>Not only did Yahoo fail to prevent the breach, it also failed to detect the breach when it happened in 2013, only realising the intrusion and data theft after recently being notified by a third party. That left users unknowingly compromised for at least three years, vulnerable to identify theft among many other potential criminal uses of their personal data and passwords.</p> <p>John Madelin, CEO at RelianceACSN and a former vice president responsible for the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, said: “We thought the previous breach of 500 million user accounts was huge, but 1 billion is monumental.”</p> <p>Tyler Moffitt, senior threat research analyst at Webroot, said: “All of the data stolen, including emails, passwords and security questions, make a potent package for identify theft. The main email account has links to other online logins and the average user likely has password overlap with multiple accounts.”</p> <p>Moffitt takes little comfort from Yahoo’s efforts to secure user accounts. He said: “These accounts have been compromised for years and the sheer number of them means they have already been a large source of identity theft. No one should have faith in Yahoo at this point.”</p> <p>Failing to prevent a breach is just one aspect of Yahoo’s fiasco. Given the sheer number of user accounts and the volume of data each one contained, data security was crucial. Unfortunately Yahoo’s disregard for the safety of user data led to the use of out-dated security techniques.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/passwords-hacking-hashing-salting-sha-2\">Passwords and hacking: the jargon of hashing, salting and SHA-2 explained</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For instance, Yahoo stored user passwords using a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/passwords-hacking-hashing-salting-sha-2\">hashing algorithm called MD5</a>, which was first published in 1992 but has inherent weaknesses that meant it was discounted as an effective method for security data from the mid–2000s.</p> <p>Jonathan Care, research director at analysts Gartner, said: “MD5 hashing is vulnerable to an attack type called ‘collision attacks’ which means that an attacker can find a string of characters that will resolve to the same hash as a hashed password. MD5 is strongly deprecated and this points to troubling software development security practices in Yahoo or its suppliers.”</p> <p>The latest data breach revelation from Yahoo – after a 500-million-user-account hack from 2014 revealed in September – paints a picture of an ageing, creaking company, failing on all counts. And with its acquisition by Verizon looming on the horizon, yet another failure on this scale will surely impact the deal in cost at the very least.</p> <p>Madelin said: “If Verizon were seeking a billion-dollar discount from the agreed $4.8bn takeover [as a result of the last breach], then logically a breach twice the size should shave off a further $2bn.</p> <p>The extensive list of hacks and data breaches revealed this year points to a worrying trend. Hackers are no longer targeting corporate networks for gain, instead going after sensitive data hiding in plain sight within personal information and correspondence.</p> <p>“Think about all of the highly sensitive files that could be lurking in these breached Yahoo email accounts: incredibly sensitive tax or financial statements, personal healthcare data, even banking or credit card information,” said Kevin Cunningham, president and founder at identify firm SailPoint.</p> <p>Cunningham said hacks of this nature, particularly of firms with weak security but obvious data stores such, will likely feature heavily in 2017.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/bt-broadband-yahoo-hack\">Millions of BT and Sky Broadband customers could be affected by Yahoo hack</a><br /></strong></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/protect-passwords-two-step-verification-encryption-digital-life-privacy\"><strong>Eight things you need to do right now to protect yourself online</strong></a></li> </ul>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>California regulators ordered Uber to remove its self-driving vehicles from the road on the same day that the company’s vehicles were caught running red lights – violations the company immediately blamed on “human error”.</p> <p>“It is essential that Uber takes appropriate measures to ensure safety of the public,” the California department of motor vehicles (DMV) wrote to Uber on Wednesday after it defied government officials and began piloting the cars in San Francisco without permits. “If Uber does not confirm immediately that it will stop its launch and seek a testing permit, DMV will initiate legal action.”</p> <p>An Uber spokesperson said two red-light violations were due to mistakes by the people required to sit behind the steering wheel and said the company has suspended the drivers.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CdJ4oae8f4\">video</a> posted by Charles Rotter, an operations manager at Luxor, a traditional cab company, shows one of Uber’s computer-controlled cars plowing through a pedestrian crosswalk in downtown about four seconds after the light turned red. Elsewhere, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnieGaus/status/809092604503560192\">photo</a> from a San Francisco writer showed one of the Uber vehicles entering an intersection against a red light.</p> <p>“People could die,” Rotter said in an interview later. “This is obviously not ready for primetime.” </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People could die. This is obviously not ready for primetime</p> <footer> <cite>Charles Rotter</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The traffic violations and threat of legal action are a significant blow to Uber in its home town, where the California department of motor vehicles has <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/14/uber-self-driving-car-program-already-stirring-controversy-california/\">said</a> that Uber requires permits to test the technology on its roads. </p> <p>Despite that stated mandate from a government agency, Uber declared in a <a href=\"https://newsroom.uber.com/san-francisco-your-self-driving-uber-is-arriving-now/\">blogpost</a> that it did not believe it needed a “testing permit” to launch self-driving vehicles in San Francisco, arguing that the rules don’t apply since the cars have people in them monitoring movements. </p> <p>“Most states see the potential benefits, especially when it comes to road safety,” wrote Anthony Levandowski, head of Uber’s advanced technology group. His post announcing the Wednesday launch noted the Volvo XC90s’ “core safety capabilities”.</p> <p>In his letter to Levandowski, the DMV’s deputy director, Brian Soublet, noted that 20 companies have already been approved to test self-driving vehicles in California. </p> <p>“They are obeying the law and are responsibly testing and advancing their technology,” he said, adding, “This technology holds the promise of true safety benefits on our roadways, but must be tested responsibly.”<strong> </strong></p> <p>The self-driving vehicles of the popular car-sharing company were first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/14/uber-self-driving-cars-pittsburgh-ford-fusion\">unveiled in Pittsburgh</a> in September. The vehicles have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/26/uber-self-driving-passengers-pittsburgh-injury-death-waiver\">technology</a> that allows them to navigate on their own, though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/19/uber-self-driving-pittsburgh-what-drivers-think\">licensed drivers sit behind the wheel</a> and can take control as necessary. </p> <p>Annie Gaus, a San Francisco writer and producer, said she was riding to work on Wednesday in a Lyft, Uber’s biggest competitor, when she saw one of the Uber self-driving vehicles nearly crash into her. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AnnieGaus/status/809092604503560192\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just passed a &#39;self-driving&#39; Uber that lurched into the intersection on Van Ness, on a red, nearly hitting my Lyft.</p>&mdash; Annie Gaus (@AnnieGaus) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnieGaus/status/809092604503560192\">December 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>She tweeted a photo of the car in the intersection after it ran the red light. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AnnieGaus/status/809092789388472320\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">(Not enough time to get a good shot, but...whoops!) <a href=\"https://t.co/XK49nMF2Q4\">pic.twitter.com/XK49nMF2Q4</a></p>&mdash; Annie Gaus (@AnnieGaus) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnieGaus/status/809092789388472320\">December 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>“The Uber car sort of jutted out into the intersection,” she told the Guardian by phone, noting that she and her Lyft driver were both taken aback. “It was close enough that we were both kind of like, ‘Woah.’ It’s close enough that you kind of react and are sort of rattled.” </p> <p>Gaus, who has written about technology and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/29/hipster-churches-sillicon-valley-evangelical-new-home\">contributed</a> to the Guardian, said the red-light violations on day one of the pilot seem to highlight how the implementation of the technology in a place like San Francisco may be premature. </p> <p>“I don’t think anybody has a good understanding of how this works in a city context.”</p> <p>An Uber spokesperson said both cars running red lights were not part of the pilot and were not carrying customers. </p> <p>“These incidents were due to human error. This is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building self-driving Ubers,” the statement said. “The drivers involved have been suspended while we continue to investigate.”</p> <p>The company did not immediately respond to questions about the state’s order to remove the cars from the road.</p> <p>It’s unclear how law enforcement may address these kinds of violations. </p> <p>Asked how the San Francisco police department would respond to a self-driving Uber running a red light, officer Giselle Talkoff said: “I don’t even know. I guess we could pull them over.” </p> <p>After the Guardian sent Talkoff footage of the Uber violation, first reported by the <a href=\"http://www.sfexaminer.com/uber-self-driving-vehicle-appears-launch-red-light-first-day-sf/\">San Francisco Examiner</a>, she said the police were not investigating the specific incident. But she noted officers would follow up in cases in which there was an injury or if they witnessed a violation in person – though she said she wasn’t sure if the “secondary driver” or the company would be held accountable.</p> <p>“There was a person that was walking very closely,” she said of the footage, pointing out that a pedestrian was entering the street when the Uber car ran the red. </p> <p>Talkoff further noted that there aren’t state or federal laws governing self-driving cars. </p> <p>“First comes technology, then comes policy. It’s going to be a matter of setting some precedents,” she said, adding, “The companies that are putting these vehicles on the road should have their vehicles operate with due regard to the rules of the road.” </p> <p>A sergeant with the police traffic division said his department was <a href=\"http://www.sfexaminer.com/sfpd-traffic-division-unaware-self-driving-uber-fleet-city-streets/\">not even aware</a> that Uber had started using autonomous cars in San Francisco. </p> <p>Rotter argued that the technology company should be held responsible for sending the vehicles out on the road despite government objections. </p> <p>“What this company has done is start operating illegally and push for permission later.”</p> <p>Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <blockquote> <p>My daughter has asked for a Windows laptop for Christmas, for schoolwork and games. I’m a Mac user and haven’t set up a Windows machine for many years so I’d appreciate any advice ... except “get her a Mac/Linux” from below the line! <strong>Stuart</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Windows has changed a lot in the past decade, and now it’s a mobile operating system. If your daughter has some experience with Google Android, she’ll probably cope quite well. Many of Windows 10’s main features came from the mobile world. These include sandboxed apps installed and updated from an online store, log-on PINs, touch screens, notifications, a voice-aware intelligent assistant (Cortana), location awareness and a “<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/11579/microsoft-account-find-lost-phone-device\">Find my device</a>” feature.</p> <p>Your daughter should ideally have some information ready before going through Windows 10’s “out of box experience”, or OOBE, as it’s known in the trade. Some are obvious: country, preferred language, time zone etc. She should also have your Wi-Fi password, and a working email address for her log-on. Otherwise, she can choose Express Settings to speed up the process. She can change the settings later.</p> <h2><strong>Microsoft Accounts</strong></h2> <p>Your daughter can use any email address as her Microsoft account (MSA). It’s the Microsoft equivalent of a Google Account (Gmail address) or an Apple ID. It’s used to link her laptop to OneDrive cloud storage, the Windows Store, Skype, <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/account/personalization\">Cortana’s personalisation data</a>, the free online Microsoft Office programs etc. It also links her PC to other Windows devices, Android and Apple smartphones and tablets, Xbox One games consoles, and so on. Finally, the MSA stores the laptop’s activation details (which used to be a product key) and encryption keys.</p> <p>People typically use an existing Microsoft email address. This can be at Hotmail, Live, MSN, Outlook.com or whatever. If she doesn’t have one, the Windows 10 set-up procedure will create one. However, it’s simpler and less stressful to have one ready to go.</p> <p>When your daughter enters her email address and password, Windows 10’s Mail app will automatically download recent emails. If she has used this account on a Windows machine before, Windows 10 will offer to set up her new laptop with the same settings. This includes her wallpaper (desktop background) and any apps she has downloaded from the Windows Store.</p> <h2><strong>Setting up</strong></h2> <p>Once logged on to Windows 10, click the Start button in the bottom left, type ‘get’ in the Search box and click the “Get Started” app. This introduces most of Windows 10’s features, and includes around 50 short videos. The What’s New section covers Cortana and the Edge browser. I strongly recommend watching Reduce Distractions, a two-minute video in the Ease of Access section. It shows how to remove unwanted animations, tiles, pinned programs, and so on.</p> <p>Frequently used programs should be pinned to the taskbar, though many people still keep icons on the desktop. Programs that aren’t used very often can be unpinned, then run from the search box, the Start menu, or a live tile.</p> <p>Next, run the Settings app (cogwheel icon) for simplified access to most of Windows 10 settings. It hasn’t completely replaced the old Control Panel, yet, but it links to Control Panel pages for more advanced settings.</p> <p>It’s a good idea to browse Settings just to see what’s where. After that, you can find things by typing a few letters into the search box, or by asking Cortana.</p> <p>The System section of the Settings app lists all the programs installed, and what they are allowed to do. The Default apps part lets users choose default programs for browsing the web, showing photos, playing music and videos, collecting emails and so on. These will be the Microsoft programs included in Windows 10, until your daughter installs alternatives.</p> <p>The Personalisation section is for picking a lockscreen photo and wallpapers, and for customising the Start menu and Taskbar. It’s where you turn off “suggested apps”.</p> <p>The Privacy section lets you opt out of personalised advertising (ie turn off your “advertising ID”), and choose which apps can use which features. Go through the Camera, Microphone and Location settings to deny access to every program all at once, or allow/deny one app at a time. Apps can’t force you to give them permissions they shouldn’t need.</p> <h2><strong>Telemetry</strong></h2> <p>The penultimate entry in Privacy is “Feedback &amp; diagnostics”. Windows versions 7 to 10 include telemetry, which means the PC sends information to Microsoft about how well it’s working. None of this is personal information – it doesn’t include the contents of files, chats or emails – and none of it is normally accessible to Microsoft staff, or anyone else. The telemetry is used for “big data” analysis based on more than 400m Windows 10 systems. Google and Facebook, among others, use the same techniques for the same purposes: to find problems, and to create more useful and more reliable software.</p> <p>You can set telemetry data to Basic, Enhanced or Full. The Basic level includes the PC’s specification, app use and any compatibility problems. The aim is to keep your PC up-to-date and working. The Enhanced level includes more advanced performance and reliability data, to check that your PC is working well. The Full level includes access to “crash dumps” (data saved after a program crashes) and the ability to trigger diagnostics. I have my PCs on Full, but crash data may contain some unwanted personal data. For example, if Microsoft Word fell over, the crash dump might well contain fragments of whatever I was writing. If that worries you, set Basic.</p> <p>Note that telemetry data is different from functional data. If Microsoft’s Mail app checks for email, or OneDrive synchronises files, or the Weather app checks your location for updates, that is not telemetry. It’s just the way every connected PC, tablet or smartphone works.</p> <h2><strong>Controlling updates</strong></h2> <p>Windows 10 is updated on a regular basis, sometimes at inconvenient times. The “Update &amp; security” section of Settings lets you set “active hours” when your PC will not install updates and restart. You can set times up to 12 hours apart, such as 8am to 8pm. Alternatively, you can choose a custom restart time when your PC will be switched on.</p> <p>The Pro and Enterprise versions of Windows 10 can postpone feature upgrades for a few months, but not essential security updates. Of course, most home users have the Home version.</p> <h2><strong>Phone companion</strong></h2> <p>Windows 10 includes <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/05/26/your-windows-10-pc-will-love-all-the-devices-you-own/\">Phone Companion</a>, an app that provides integration with a Windows, Android or Apple smartphone or tablet. Plug your device into a USB port and the app helps you set up Cortana (if available), photos, music, to-do lists, Skype, email, and online Microsoft Office apps. Of course, you still have to download the Microsoft apps from iTunes, Google Play or the Windows Store.</p> <p>You can plug a phone or tablet into a Windows 10 laptop and use File Explorer to copy files manually. However, OneDrive can automatically collect camera roll photos from your smartphone and copy them to your PC, which is handy. You can also create playlists and play tracks from OneDrive on your phone.</p> <h2><strong>Next week</strong></h2> <p>Setting up a new laptop usually involves downloading a selection of familiar programs, often starting with a web browser such as Firefox or Google Chrome. I’ll cover that topic next week ...</p> <p><strong>Have you got another question for Jack? Email it to <a href=\"mailto:Ask.Jack@theguardian.com\">Ask.Jack@theguardian.com</a></strong></p>',\n",

Was it open and freely available, or was it hashed, secured and practically unbreakable?</p> <p>From cleartext to hashed, salted, peppered and bcrypted, here’s what the impenetrable jargon of password security really means.</p> <h2><strong>The terminology</strong></h2> <p><strong>Plain text</strong></p> <p>When something is described being stored as “cleartext” or as “plain text” it means that thing is in the open as simple text – with no security beyond a simple access control to the database which contains it.</p> <p>If you have access to the database containing the passwords you can read them just as you can read the text on this page.</p> <p><strong>Hashing</strong></p> <p>When a password has been “hashed” it means it has been turned into a scrambled representation of itself. A user’s password is taken and – using a key known to the site – the hash value is derived from the combination of both the password and the key, using a set algorithm.</p> <p>To verify a user’s password is correct it is hashed and the value compared with that stored on record each time they login.</p> <p>You cannot directly turn a hashed value into the password, but you can work out what the password is if you continually generate hashes from passwords until you find one that matches, a so-called brute-force attack, or similar methods.</p> <p><strong>Salting</strong></p> <p>Passwords are often described as “hashed and salted”. Salting is simply the addition of a unique, random string of characters known only to the site to each password before it is hashed, typically this “salt” is placed in front of each password.</p> <p>The salt value needs to be stored by the site, which means sometimes sites use the same salt for every password. This makes it less effective than if individual salts are used.</p> <p>The use of unique salts means that common passwords shared by multiple users – such as “123456” or “password” – aren’t immediately revealed when one such hashed password is identified – because despite the passwords being the same the salted and hashed values are not.<br /></p> <p>Large salts also protect against certain methods of attack on hashes, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table\">rainbow tables</a> or logs of hashed passwords previously broken.</p> <p>Both hashing and salting can be repeated more than once to increase the difficulty in breaking the security.</p> <p><strong>Peppering</strong></p> <p>Cryptographers like their seasonings. A “pepper” is similar to a salt - a value added to the password before being hashed - but typically placed at the end of the password.</p> <p>There are broadly two versions of pepper. The first is simply a known secret value added to each password, which is only beneficial if it is not known by the attacker.</p> <p>The second is a value that’s randomly generated but never stored. That means every time a user attempts to log into the site it has to try multiple combinations of the pepper and hashing algorithm to find the right pepper value and match the hash value.</p> <p>Even with a small range in the unknown pepper value, trying all the values can take minutes per login attempt, so is rarely used. </p> <p><strong>Encryption</strong></p> <p>Encryption, like hashing, is a function of cryptography, but the main difference is that encryption is something you can undo, while hashing is not. If you need to access the source text to change it or read it, encryption allows you to secure it but still read it after decrypting it. Hashing cannot be reversed, which means you can only know what the hash represents by matching it with another hash of what you think is the same information.</p> <p>If a site such as a bank asks you to verify particular characters of your password, rather than enter the whole thing, it is encrypting your password as it must decrypt it and verify individual characters rather than simply match the whole password to a stored hash.</p> <p>Encrypted passwords are typically used for second-factor verification, rather than as the primary login factor.</p> <p><strong>Hexadecimal</strong></p> <p>A hexadecimal number, also simply known as “hex” or “base 16”, is way of representing values of zero to 15 as using 16 separate symbols. The numbers 0-9 represent values zero to nine, with a, b, c, d, e and f representing 10-15.</p> <p>They are widely used in computing as a human-friendly way of representing binary numbers. Each hexadecimal digit represents four <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit\">bits</a> or half a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte\">byte</a>.</p> <h2>The algorithms </h2> <p><strong>MD5</strong></p> <p>Originally designed as a cryptographic hashing algorithm, first published in 1992, MD5 has been shown to have extensive weaknesses, which make it relatively easy to break.</p> <p>Its 128-bit hash values, which are quite easy to produce, are more commonly used for file verification to make sure that a downloaded file has not been tampered with. It should not be used to secure passwords.</p> <p><strong>SHA-1</strong></p> <p>Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) is cryptographic hashing algorithm originally design by the US National Security Agency in 1993 and published in 1995.</p> <p>It generates 160-bit hash value that is typically rendered as a 40-digit hexadecimal number. As of 2005, SHA-1 was deemed as no longer secure as the exponential increase in computing power and sophisticated methods meant that it was possible to perform a so-called attack on the hash and produce the source password or text without spending millions on computing resource and time.</p> <p><strong>SHA-2</strong></p> <p>The successor to SHA-1, Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-2) is a family of hash functions that produce longer hash values with 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits, written as SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 or SHA-512.</p> <p>It was first published in 2001, designed by again by the NSA, and an effective attack has yet to be demonstrated against it. That means SHA-2 is generally recommended for secure hashing.</p> <p>SHA-3, while not a replacement for SHA-2, was developed not by the NSA but by Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, Michaël Peeters and Gilles Van Assche from STMicroelectronics and Radboud University in Nijmegen, Netherlands. It was standardised in 2015.</p> <p><strong>Bcrypt</strong></p> <p>As computational power has increased the number of brute-force guesses a hacker can make for an efficient hashing algorithm has increased exponentially.</p> <p>Bcrypt, which is based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)\">Blowfish cipher</a> and includes a salt, is designed to protect against brute-force attacks by intentionally being slower to operate. It has a so-called work factor that effectively puts your password through a definable number of rounds of extension before being hashed.</p> <p>By increasing the work factor it takes longer to brute-force the password and match the hash. The theory is that the site owner sets a sufficiently high-enough work factor to reduce the number of guesses today’s computers can make at the password and extend the time from days or weeks to months or years, making it prohibitively time consuming and expensive.</p> <p><strong>PBKDF2</strong></p> <p>Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2), developed by RSA Laboratories, is another algorithm for key extension that makes hashes more difficult to brute force. It is considered slightly easier to brute force than Bcrypt at a certain value because it requires less computer memory to run the algorithm.</p> <p><strong>Scrypt</strong></p> <p>Scrypt like Bcrypt and PBKDF2 is an algorithm that extends keys and makes it harder to brute-force attack a hash. Unlike PBKDF2, however, scrypt is designed to use either a large amount of computer memory or force many more calculations as it runs.</p> <p>For legitimate users having to only hash one password to check if it matches a stored value, the cost is negligible. But for someone attempting to try 100,000s of passwords it makes cost of doing so much higher or take prohibitively long.</p> <h2>But what about the passwords?</h2> <p>If a password is properly hashed using SHA-2 or newer, and is salted, then to break a password requires a brute-force attack.<br /></p> <p>The longer the password, the longer the brute-force attack is going to last. And the longer the brute-force attack required, the more time-consuming and expensive it is to match the hash and discover the password.</p> <p>Which means the longer the password the better, but the configuration of the password also makes a difference. A truly random eight-character password will be more secure than a eight-letter dictionary word, because brute-force attacks use dictionaries, names and other lists of words as fodder.</p> <p>However, if the site stores your password as plain text it doesn’t matter how long your password is if the database is stolen.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/protect-passwords-two-step-verification-encryption-digital-life-privacy\"><strong>Eight things you need to do right now to protect yourself online</strong></a><br /></li> </ul>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<h2>1. Use unique passwords for all your accounts</h2> <p><strong>What: </strong>Stop kidding yourself that you only re-use passwords on accounts that don’t matter, or that you have an unbreakable password scheme that no one else can guess. Every single thing with a password needs to have a unique password, shared with nothing else. </p> <p><strong>Why: </strong>Services get hacked, with entire databases of passwords published in the open. People get “phished”, tricked into entering their passwords into shady imitations of the sites they intended to visit. If this happens, you want to limit the damage, ensuring that only one site gets breached.</p> <p><strong>How: </strong>Unless you absolutely categorically have a reason not to …</p> <h2>2. Use a password manager<br /></h2> <p><strong>What: </strong>Software like LastPass (free) or 1Password ($2.99/month or $49), which will store your passwords, generate secure random ones for you, and sync them across multiple devices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9196a818838726add06dc73438ccaf9745e0683c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9196a818838726add06dc73438ccaf9745e0683c/2_2_854_513/500.jpg\" alt=\"Software like LastPass will store your passwords, generate secure random ones for you, and sync them across multiple devices.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Software like LastPass will store your passwords, generate secure random ones for you, and sync them across multiple devices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LastPass</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Why: </strong>If you can memorise all your passwords, you can almost guarantee that they aren’t varied enough to be secure. A password manager may feel like putting all your eggs in one basket, but it’s a padded secure basket kept up-to-date by the best minds in the basket business, and what you’re doing right now is more like juggling the eggs above your head while blindfolded.</p> <p><strong>How: </strong>Download the password manager, install it on your desktop (you can do mobile later), and start running it. You don’t even have to change your passwords all at once: the manager will notice when you log in, and ask you whether you want to save the new password. That should be your cue to create a new one.</p> <h2>3) Use random passwords</h2> <p><strong>What: </strong>Once you’ve got your password manager, use it to generate secure random passwords for you, rather than trying to invent your own.</p> <p><strong>Why: </strong>You aren’t as random as you think, and “brute forcing” passwords – systematically trying every variation until you succeed – is getting quicker at the same rate computers are. If you have a handy method for creating passwords, like “take the first letter of every word in a line of poetry”, then someone else has probably also realised the same thing, and written a programme to automatically guess those passwords. Try searching Google for “<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp#safe=off&amp;q=tbontbtitq\">tbontbtitq</a>” (or “to be or not to be, that is the question”) if you don’t believe me.</p> <p><strong>How: </strong>You’ve already got your password manager set up, yes? Even if you haven’t, some browsers will do it for you. Apple’s Safari, for instance, will happily generate random passwords when signing up for new accounts, then store them in iCloud Keychain.</p> <h2>4. Turn on two-step verification everywhere you can</h2> <p><strong>What: </strong>Many services, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Tumblr and more, let you enable two-step verification, also known as two-factor authentication. As well as a password, you need to prove you have access to a second trusted device, normally a phone, to log on. How you prove that varies: sometimes a text is sent, sometimes you use a special app, sometimes you just hit a notification on your phone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5604706f6244e2d5e3a1bbf41b456b36c6ec40a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5604706f6244e2d5e3a1bbf41b456b36c6ec40a/0_0_2621_1573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"2-step-verification-code\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">2-step-verification-code</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Why: </strong>Two-step verification prevents a third-party from logging in to your accounts even if they have managed to steal your password. It’s an added layer of security, which makes it very difficult indeed to hack in to protect accounts.</p> <p><strong>How: </strong>Every service has a different method for enabling the process, which hurts take-up, but handy resource <a href=\"https://www.turnon2fa.com/\">Turn On 2FA</a> will walk you through it for all the sites you use.</p> <h2>5. Update your software</h2> <p><strong>What: </strong>Most software has an automatic update function. Use it.</p> <p><strong>Why: </strong>Most hacks are carried out by attacking software using weaknesses that were known, and fixed, long ago. It’s like we’ve invented vaccines, but you’re still catching smallpox. Particular focus should be paid to your operating system, web browser, and Adobe Flash.</p> <p><strong>How: </strong>Enable automatic updates. </p> <h2>6. Put a six-digit PIN on your phone and set it to wipe if it’s guessed wrongly too many times</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bc80c633ccb91e5110886366caf841ae5cbb87c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bc80c633ccb91e5110886366caf841ae5cbb87c/0_39_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On an iPhone, open settings, hit Touch ID &amp; Passcode, flick on Erase Data, and click Change Passcode to set it to a six-digit PIN.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On an iPhone, open settings, hit Touch ID &amp; Passcode, flick on Erase Data, and click Change Passcode to set it to a six-digit PIN.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What: </strong>Your phone has the ability to require a PIN before it is unlocked it. Use it. </p> <p><strong>Why: </strong>If your phone gets taken while it’s unlocked, there’s not much you can do. But if it’s locked when it gets stolen, you can prevent the bad loss of hundreds of pounds of technology from turning into the loss of enough personal data to have your identity stolen too. </p> <p><strong>How: </strong>On an iPhone, open settings, hit Touch ID &amp; Passcode, flick on Erase Data, and click Change Passcode to set it to a six-digit PIN. Almost every Android is different, but look for a “security” menu in the settings app, sometimes under “personal”. Then, head to the “lock screen” menu to enable the auto-erase feature.</p> <h2>7. Enable full-disk encryption</h2> <p><strong>What:</strong> Your computer’s hard drive can be set to automatically encrypt when it’s turned off.</p> <p><strong>Why: </strong>You think the risk of identity theft is bad when your phone is stolen, just think what happens when your computer is lifted.</p> <p><strong>How: </strong>On a Mac, <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204837\">enable FileVault</a>; on Windows, <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/2308725/encryption/a-beginners-guide-to-bitlocker-windows-built-in-encryption-tool.html\">turn on BitLocker</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/2016/sep/19/how-to-contact-the-guardian-securely\">How to contact the Guardian securely</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>8. Back-up to an external hard drive</h2> <p><strong>What: </strong>Everything on your computer should be stored on a physically separate hard drive under your possession. Ideally, everything on your phone should be stored on your computer which should then be etc etc.<br /></p> <p><strong>Why: </strong>If the worst happens, and you lose everything, you need to be able to restore. This could happen because of a ransomware attack, because someone decided to personally ruin your life, or just because of a literal lighting strike. Cloud storage will help, but cloud platforms go bust unexpectedly, are just as vulnerable to hacking, and have an annoying tendency to “mirror” your computer – meaning something deleted from your local storage can be deleted from the cloud at the same time.<br /></p> <p><strong>How: </strong>Buy a cheap USB hard drive. If you use a Mac, just leave it plugged in and enable Time Machine; if you have a Windows PC, plug it in and <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17127/windows-back-up-restore\">follow these instructions</a>. </p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/14/yahoo-hack-security-of-one-billion-accounts-breached\"><strong>Yahoo hack: 1bn accounts compromised by biggest data breach in history</strong></a></li> </ul>',\n",

That may sound like a faintly sinister concept, but it was in fact stupidly idyllic. The eight-week event, organised by alumni from game publishers Rovio and King, took place in adorable red wooden cabins perched on a hill overlooking a lake – apparently called “Bjursen”, although we just called it The Lake, because we couldn’t pronounce anything correctly. While not working on our game development projects, we watched meteor showers from a nearby mountaintop, swam beneath the Northern Lights, and sat around a campfire getting sloshed on schnapps.</p> <p>The Stugan attendees were from all over the world, but we’d ended up in this tiny corner of Scandinavia, brought together by the one thing we shared: the desire to create and play video games. I turned up three weeks late, and already an outsider as the only journalist, but within a few days I felt like I’d been welcomed as one of the team. There with me were people like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nothke\">Ivan Notaros</a>, an incredibly talented Serbian developer who was ostensibly making a game called House of Flowers based on his experience and knowledge of the war in Yugoslavia in the 90s, but spent much of his time making tiny games, procedurally generated art, and incredible low-res photogrammetry of us as a group. There were Michael and Laura, a married team who were making a game despite being animators rather than programmers, using their artistic style to inform what their project, Thin Air, would become.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7h6-sjLwLg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E7h6-sjLwLg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Stugan (Swedish for ‘cabin’) is a two-month game creation retreat.

Robbie, Dorianne and Marc, the only three-person team, all from South Africa, were working on Kingdom in the Sky, a project they’d been unable to work on for months because of their full-time jobs. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EVL8LOvXdk\">Mira and Tanja</a>, a team of two women, one Swedish and one Danish, collaborated on their two-player game Tick Tock, when they weren’t playing incredibly tense rounds of Magic: The Gathering. The trailers of these games, and the others made during Stugan 2016, are <a href=\"http://www.stugan.com/stugan-2016/\">all worth watching</a>.<br /></p> <p>It’s largely because of Stugan that I’ve started making my own games. My first - <a href=\"https://kategray.itch.io/awkward-dating-simulator\">Awkward Dating Simulator</a> - has been downloaded over 1,000 times already, which is amazing and terrifying. Next year, I’ll be taking part in Train Jam - a 52-hour train ride from Chicago to the annual Game Developer’s Conference in San Francisco, where developers make games as the scenery rushes by. I’m doing it just to be around those people and that feeling again. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IndieTrainJam/status/708320843319910401\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The best kind of inspiration <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/trainjam?src=hash\">#trainjam</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/bZco7u7irk\">pic.twitter.com/bZco7u7irk</a></p>&mdash; Train Jam (@IndieTrainJam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IndieTrainJam/status/708320843319910401\">March 11, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>There has always been an independent game development community. In the early 1980s, small teams made their own games, downloaded them on to cassettes and sold them at trade fairs, bypassing the retail business that was growing around software. In the 90s, the rise of the internet meant these developers had the ability to sell their games digitally, to a global audience, without ever having to produce or distribute physical copies. More recently, platforms like Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network and the PC games service Steam have given indie developers access to huge online stores where they can sell their often offbeat and idiosyncratic games alongside major releases.</p> <p>Now, perhaps more than ever, independent games – and the communities that make them – have a vital role in video game culture. The mainstream games business, similar to the mainstream movie business, is mostly about noise and bombast. Triple A titles are sold on action and violence; the industry’s biggest annual events E3 and Gamescom are cacophonous battle zones, where the loudest, brightest booths inevitably win (last time I went to E3, one major games publisher was issued a warning by the event organiser because their booth was so loud no one else could get anything done).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD-gh_O3eaA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XD-gh_O3eaA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Indie games can often be about action and violence, too, but the creative atmosphere is very different. Instead of E3, the indie sector runs events like Mild Rumpus, a sweet, relaxing space taking up one corner of the otherwise frenetic GDC, where attendees could play titles like <a href=\"https://vltmn.itch.io/lieve-oma\">Lieve Oma</a>, a game about taking a walk in the woods with a beloved grandma, or <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/365580/\">Beeswing</a>, a semi-autobiographical game set in a small village in Scotland. This summer, London’s Somerset House hosted <a href=\"http://nowplaythis.net/\">Now Play This</a>, a collection of innovative experimental games and installations, beautifully curated and housed within a disused wing of the grand building. Here we played reflective, artistic titles like the painterly pinball sim Inks and beautiful Where’s Wally-like puzzler <a href=\"http://hiddenfolks.com/\">Hidden Folks</a>. </p> <p>Recently, the first ever IndieCade Europe event took place in Paris, nestled in the alcoves of a grand 18th-century museum. The highlights for me were games like <a href=\"http://www.chalochalogame.com/\">Chalo Chalo</a>, a simple but brilliant multiplayer racing game that feels tense despite its treacle-slow movements; the incredibly heartbreaking <a href=\"http://www.killingtimeatlightspeed.com/\">Killing Time At Lightspeed</a>, in which you can read your friends’ social interactions, but you’re light-years away, so every page refresh is another two years into the future; and <a href=\"http://www.oldmansjourney.com/\">Old Man’s Journey</a>, a game about exactly what the title suggests, with a stunning art style.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82c7aa0f4e0e905d0fea9b6c58b1de83658e76fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82c7aa0f4e0e905d0fea9b6c58b1de83658e76fe/0_33_1744_1047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chalo Chalo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simple but brilliant … Chalo Chalo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sparpweed/Redshift Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Within these quiet, gentle spaces, there is an atmosphere of care rather than competition. AAA games are still, for the most part, thrilling and worth talking about, but, for me at least, they’re a business. At Stugan, people talked about their projects, worked with each other, and understood when others just needed to walk up the mountain alone. In the indie game community, when problems arise, people discuss them and share resources and experience. This almost certainly happens in the mainstream industry, but there it’s confidential and hidden. Here, it is simply a part of how things work. Successful indie developers like <a href=\"http://www.pentadact.com/\">Tom Francis</a> (one of the attendees at Stugan and the guy behind crossover hit Gunpoint) write development blogs and talk about their design issues in video updates. Small studios even set up webcams and live stream the development process.</p> <p>It’s this transparency and openness that makes the community feel welcoming. There is a softness, a kindness, a sincerity, that you don’t see often in the churn of the games industry at large. Being an indie developer is incredibly hard work. A lot of teams meet and collaborate online, often living thousands of miles apart, so their work is carried out through late night Skype calls and Google hangouts; they conduct hundreds of long-distance relationships with players and other developers through social media streams; they have to manage and juggle time zones as well as any international stock trader. So when an event takes place, it can often be more like family reunion than a showcase. Developers hug each other tight because they don’t know when they’ll next see each other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae359a406f04ea40a86fa7c6bf33ecb8a4d6bad7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae359a406f04ea40a86fa7c6bf33ecb8a4d6bad7/0_0_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Orchids to Dusk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orchids to Dusk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pol Clarissou</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This sense of openness and compassion is flowing into the games. An emerging generation of developers want to share themselves through the work they produce, to connect with others in the same way as singer-songwriters in the 1960s or indie bands in the 1970s and 1980s. They’re willing to be vulnerable with strangers, and they’re willing to explore the parameters of what games are in order to communicate how they feel. Pol Clarissou, another of the Stugan alumni, makes games like <a href=\"https://polclarissou.itch.io/orchids-to-dusk\">Orchids to Dusk</a>, in which there is limited interaction, and nothing you can do to save yourself – a game that teaches you the world is sometimes just as it is, and the only thing you can do is experience it. </p> <p>In the last year we have also seen games like <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/408120/\">Cibele</a>, in which creator Nina Freeman provides an incredibly personal semi-autobiographical story of heartbreak. We’ve seen Lucy Blundell’s uncomfortable morning-after narrative, <a href=\"http://lucyblundell.weebly.com/one-night-stand.html\">One Night Stand</a>, which puts a stranger in your bed and asks you how you feel now you’ve woken next to them. These games – so open and honest with the feelings they explore – exist because the developers couldn’t see their lives, selves or experiences reflected in mainstream games, and so created them themselves. In turn, that inspires others to do the same.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEJqyd-5VCI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEJqyd-5VCI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>This growing counter-culture of highly personal, highly experimental game design has faced criticism, resistance and even aggression from incumbent communities – the self-identifying ‘gamers’ – who think they know what games should be: the same thing they’ve always been. Many people who demand guns, explosions and intensity (which is all good), somehow see the existence of quiet, kind, thoughtful games as a threat. In 2013, when the developer Zoe Quinn released her interactive fiction game Depression Quest on PC, she was <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/zoe-quinns-depression-quest\">threatened with physical harm</a>. Dealing with mental health was considered provocative. Somehow in video games, vulnerability is a political act.</p> <p>The games I saw being made at Stugan, being shown and shared at IndieCade, Now Play This and Mild Rumpus, are important and they will not be pushed from the industry. Video games are culture, and culture reflects life. For a lot of people, life is hard right now: global economies are failing, money is tight; 2016 has been a year of mourning and political upheaval, old certainties have crumbled. It’s no coincidence that we’ve seen an explosion of interest in self-care concepts like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/22/hygge-conspiracy-denmark-cosiness-trend\">hygge</a> and mindfulness. In difficult times, we seek simple, meaningful pleasures: we need to take care of ourselves, we need to wrap ourselves up against the cold.</p> <p>Not all of the games I’ve seen this year are comforting or “nice” in the sense of being pleasant experiences. But they are real, personal and powerful. Like all true art, they invite us into the most intimate thoughts and feelings of others. Sometimes that’s what is needed: a way back to the warmth.</p> <h2>Five personal games to look out for in 2017</h2> <p><em>A selection of highly subjective and intimate projects set to arrive next year </em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d10c86d3dc4d8ec70a5827987a93ccc1c86d3278\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d10c86d3dc4d8ec70a5827987a93ccc1c86d3278/17_33_819_491/500.png\" alt=\"29\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The kind of place you want to climb inside and live in … 29.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Humble Grove</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://humblegrove.itch.io/29\">29</a> (Humble Grove)</strong></p> <p>The borderless, softened colours of 29 evoke the kind of place you want to climb inside and live in, even if one of its inhabitants is a huge, many-eyed monster. It follows two housemates, both transgender and non-binary, as they co-exist and explore their corner of the world. Their story is told in snippets and parenthetical observations, and it’s beautiful, calm and quiet.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://vignettesga.me/\">Vignettes</a> (</strong>Pol Clarissou, Armel Gibson and Pat Ashe)</p> <p>Sometimes there comes an idea that’s so perfect and simple that you wonder how it hasn’t been done before. Vignettes is a game, at its heart, about rotating things until they change into other things, but it’s so much more than that: it’s a game about appreciating design, noticing details, immersing yourself in simple interactions. Many games give you control over the world; Vignettes gives you control over one object, asking you to focus, almost like cognitive behavioural therapy, on one thing at a time.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://ooblets.com/\">Ooblets</a> (</strong>Nonplayercat and Perplamps)</p> <p>Pokémon is great, but the thread of any Pokémon game is to fight to the finish line. Ooblets is more like a walk in the woods, accompanied by a host of cute lumpy friends that toddle behind you like something in between a puppy and a two-year-old. Its palette is that of an old-fashioned sweet shop; its design is Adventure Time-esque, sweet but knowingly humorous. Every gif that the (two!) developers post on Twitter is filled with lightness and the kind of heartwarming loveliness that we could definitely do with right now.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.oldmansjourney.com/\">Old Man’s Journey</a> (Broken Rules)</strong></p> <p>OK, first off, Old Man’s Journey is the only game I know of that has given out temporary tattoos as part of their promotional merch. Secondly, this game is an absolute joy to look at and play. It’s reminiscent of a run-down but well-loved seaside town, in which you help an old man clamber around, sitting down now and again to reminisce about his long lost past. It’s beautifully layered, creating a sense of depth and warmth that invites you to explore and discover more.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://secretlegendgame.com/\">Secret Legend</a> (Andrew Shouldice)</strong></p> <p>When we’re most stressed, we retreat into behaviours that remind us of the safety of childhood. Nostalgic experiences are soothing, because they coax out memories of happier, simpler times. With soft, dappled light, gentle colours and music, and a very obvious Zelda influence, Secret Legend is the game to play if you want to escape from everything new into something that feels so comforting and familiar that it might have just been in your pocket the whole time.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Amazon says it has successfully trialled its Prime Air drone delivery service in Cambridge, UK, by delivering a TV streaming stick and bag of popcorn directly to the garden of a nearby customer.</p> <p>The breakthrough suggests that autonomous aerial delivery could become a viable business sooner than thought, albeit only for customers with huge gardens, who live close to the delivery depot, and want items weighing less than 2.6kg.</p> <p>Additionally, while deliveries will be available seven days a week, the drones can only fly in daylight hours and clement weather. Currently, the trial is only open to two customers, but Amazon says it hopes to expand that to dozens in the coming months. For those customers, Prime Air is available for no extra cost.</p> <p>The company says the delivery, which took place last week, involved fully autonomous flight, with no human pilot involved in the process. The success was announced by Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/809034847121350657\">who tweeted</a>: “first ever #AmazonPrimeAir customer delivery is in the books. 13 min—click to delivery.” Amazon released a video of the flight but no press were invited to witness the test.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/809034847121350657\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">First-ever <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AmazonPrimeAir?src=hash\">#AmazonPrimeAir</a> customer delivery is in the books. 13 min—click to delivery.

That was when the company invited the Civil Aviation Authority to witness its first test flight.</p> <p>Government regulations in the UK are generally considered favourable to companies wanting to experiment with autonomous aircraft, but the restrictions still heavily limit what Amazon can test. The company is allowed to test drones that fly beyond line-of-sight in rural and suburban areas; flights where one person operates multiple largely autonomous drones; and sensor performance associated with sense-and-avoid technology.</p> <p>Amazon first announced its intention to deliver packages by drone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/02/amazon-drone-delivery-jeff-bezos-hype\">in 2013</a>, in a lavishly-produced special on US TV show 60 Minutes. At the time, Bezos suggested that the company would begin delivery in 2018, a timescale commentators called “hugely optimistic”, citing a number of concerns around theft, liability and safety. The latest limited trials suggest that Amazon still intends to hit that 2018 target, albeit by sidestepping many of the concerns through the limited nature of the rollout.</p> <p>Amazon isn’t alone in the field: Google’s experimental sibling, X, has a long-running drone delivery project of its own, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/03/alphabet-testing-project-wing-delivery-drones-us\">Project Wing</a>. Its prototypes use a fixed-wing drone, and are aimed at deliveries to particularly isolated rural customers.</p>',\n",

It also mounted a protest at the City of London offices of Salesforce, a US computing company that is a major Uber client.</p> <p>Two Uber drivers, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, took Uber to court on behalf of a group 19 others who argued that they were employed by the San Francisco-based company, rather than working for themselves. Uber’s business model has been based on treating drivers who log on to its app as self-employed contractors and taking a cut of their fares, which Uber dictates.</p> <p>The employment tribunal judges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/uber-uk-tribunal-self-employed-status\">were scathing about Uber’s case</a> that drivers who use its phone app to pick up fares were self-employed.</p> <p>“The notion that Uber in London is a mosaic of 30,000 small businesses linked by a common ‘platform’ is to our minds faintly ridiculous,” they said. “Drivers do not and cannot negotiate with passengers … They are offered and accept trips strictly on Uber’s terms.”</p> <p>Farrar said Uber’s appeal was expected but was “really disappointing”. “It means we have to fight again, but why?” he said. “It is just because they don’t want to pay the minimum wage. We are confident. Our case is rock solid and the original judgment was emphatic.”</p> <p>Jo Bertram, Uber’s UK general manager, said: “Tens of thousands of people in London drive with Uber precisely because they want to be self-employed and their own boss. The overwhelming majority of drivers who use the Uber app want to keep the freedom and flexibility of being able to drive when and where they want.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, 25 more Uber drivers are planning to claim workers’ rights from Uber and have joined the legal action the law firm Leigh Day is bringing with the GMB union.</p> <p>“Since the judgment was issued, we and GMB have spoken to hundreds of Uber drivers who wish to claim compensation for Uber’s failure to provide these entitlements in the past, as well as to ensure that they are paid at least the national minimum wage and holiday pay in future,” said Nigel MacKay, the lawyer representing the claimants. </p> <p>“We are issuing claims on behalf of those drivers and the latest 25 claimants who have joined the legal action will be included in claims for compensation. We anticipate issuing further claims on behalf of drivers in the coming weeks.”</p> <p>Leigh Day believes there may be thousands of drivers who can claim for the money and benefits they have not received as drivers for Uber.</p> <p>Uber’s appeal comes amid mounting concern within the government about the growing trend towards self-employed workforces. The government has recently announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-hires-former-tony-blair-policy-boss-to-review-workers-rights\">a six-month review of modern working practices</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/hmrc-launch-crackdown-gig-economy-firms-agency-self-employed-staff\">HMRC is setting up a new unit</a>, the employment status and intermediaries team, to investigate companies.</p> <p>Last week Frank Field, the chairman of the House of Commons work and pensions select committee, published a report including the testimonies of 83 Uber drivers, which claimed that they had almost no independence. </p> <p>Field’s report, contested by Uber, said the company dictates drivers’ working patterns once they have logged on, imposes lockouts from its system if drivers turn down too many jobs, and has raised its commission while cutting the rates drivers can charge. This, combined with the cost of the vehicles needed to meet Uber’s requirements, is creating “chronically low pay” and insecurity, the report said.</p>',\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>Google’s self-driving cars have graduated from the company’s “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/05/x-projects-alphabet-moonshot-ventures-change-world-robots\">moonshot division</a>”, X labs, to become a full-blown subsidiary of umbrella group Alphabet, called Waymo.</p> <p>The new company, headed by X alumni John Krafcik, is charged with turning the self-driving car technology that Google has been developing behind closed doors into a viable business for the future.</p> <p>How that will actually happen, though, Waymo has apparently not yet decided. Mooted revenue streams include Uber-style driverless ride sharing, disrupting the trucking and logistics sector, fitting self-driving technology into public transit vehicles, improving the “last mile” of postal delivery or even simply licensing the software to car manufacturers who will sell cars to end users.</p> <p>“Self-driving technology is awesome in all these categories,” said Krafcik at an event to announce the launch of Waymo. But one thing Waymo won’t be doing is building its own cars – a step back in ambition from the highest goals of the X labs team.</p> <p>“We are a self-driving technology company,” Krafcik said. “We’ve been really clear that we’re not a car company, although there’s been some confusion on that point. We’re not in the business of making better cars. We’re in the business of making better drivers.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7f3529742c1f495711e6f5240427bace5fe94d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7f3529742c1f495711e6f5240427bace5fe94d2/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The front of a Waymo driverless car is seen during a Google event, Tuesday, Dec. 13, 2016, in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The small, purpose-built ‘Koala cars’ that Google currently uses for testing its self-driving technology are unlikely to evolve into an actual product that consumers can buy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That means the small, purpose-built “Koala cars” that Google currently uses for testing its self-driving technology are unlikely to evolve into an actual product that consumers can buy. Instead, the best hope for someone who wants to get their hands on Google’s software looks to be Fiat Chrysler, who signed a deal with Google in May to put its self-driving tech in a small fleet of the company’s Pacifica minivans. If that deal expands into a full-blown partnership, Fiat Chrysler could be the first company selling Google tech to end users.</p> <p>If not Fiat Chrysler, Waymo will have to pair with someone, because Google is fast becoming a victim of its own success. When the company first initiated its self-driving product at X Labs, it was almost alone in Silicon Valley in thinking that self-driving cars were a solvable problem. But as the years progressed, others joined the field, some directly inspired by Google’s success: Uber’s Travis Kalanick has spoken about how he was inspired to enter the self-driving car business by a ride in one of Google’s prototypes. He promptly hired a substantial portion of Carnegie-Mellon university’s ground-breaking robotics lab.</p> <p>Conventional auto manufacturers have also entered the fray: as well as Tesla Motors, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/11/tesla-self-driving-cars-autopilot-update\">Autopilot</a> system is one of the most advanced driver-assist features on the market, older businesses like Ford, BMW and Nissan have all pushed their own automation systems onto the market.</p> <p>Part of the reason for Google losing its lead in the market was the company’s insistence on only pursuing full automation. “The system we have built is aimed at full autonomy, and it is therefore much more complicated than a lot of these other systems,” X labs engineer Andrew Chatham <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/22/google-x-self-driving-cars\">told the Guardian in August</a>. “This is not the engineeringly efficient or cost-effective way to build something that just helps you stay in your lane.”</p> <p>It is unclear whether Waymo will continue that all-or-nothing goal. Google proudly trumpeted a previously secret milestone it had achieved in the summer of 2015, when a blind man, Steve Mahan, had “driven”, unaccompanied, one of its Koala cars on the public roads of Austin, Texas. That trip was the world’s first fully driverless trip on public roads.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"522744c0a5f4cb9f389045b2d6bf315f459f3926\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/522744c0a5f4cb9f389045b2d6bf315f459f3926/0_158_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Mahan, who is blind, stands by the Waymo driverless car during a Google event, Tuesday, Dec. 13, 2016, in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Mahan, who is blind, stands by the Waymo driverless car during a Google event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But behind the scenes, reports suggest that Waymo might pull the trigger on the technology earlier than the company intended to when it was simply a research lab. On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-scaled-back-self-driving-car-ambitions\">industry news site The Information reported</a> the groundbreaking partnership with Fiat Chrysler had represented one step towards that intermediary goal, to the concern of some of Google’s self-driving engineers.</p> <p>Some of those engineers have left the company since the new direction was decided at the start of 2016. Chris Urmson, the former head of the division, quit this summer to start a new company, less than a year after Krafcik was hired. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/19/self-driving-car-anthony-levandowski-uber-otto-google\">Anthony Levandowski</a>, one of the industry’s pioneers, left in early 2016 to found a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/17/self-driving-trucks-otto-startup\">self-driving truck startup, Otto</a>, which has since been acquired by Uber. Jiajun Zhu, a founder member of the team, and software engineering manager Dave Ferguson left in the summer to co-found <a href=\"http://www.recode.net/2016/9/15/12921542/google-self-driving-startup-nuro\">autonomous car company Nuro</a>. In total, 14 members of the team are known to have left in 2016 alone.</p> <p>As a fully standalone unit, Waymo will have more power within the wider Alphabet hierarchy to set its priorities and decide its own future. But that power also comes with responsibility: for the first time, Google’s self-driving cars will have a bottom line, and an expectation that, at some point, it will start paying its own way. Simply making the best technology isn’t the only requirement to making money in the car industry – Waymo also needs to make friends.</p>',\n",

DOOM does away with all of that. Its stroke of genius is the glory kill system, which incentivises aggression.

According to a <a href=\"http://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Immigrants-and-Billion-Dollar-Startups.NFAP-Policy-Brief.March-2016.pdf\">study by the National Foundation for American Policy</a>, immigrants founded more than half (51%) of the current crop of US-based startups valued at more than $1bn.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/11/silicon-valley-donald-trump-critics-tech-reactions\">Ctrl+Z: Silicon Valley leaders U-turn on Donald Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All of this could be under threat if we are to take some of the comments the Trump campaign made in the run-up to the election at face value. The outspoken candidate claimed that Mark Zuckerberg’s push for specialist H1B visas (the main visa used to hire foreign talent to tech companies) <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/17/news/companies/donald-trump-mark-zuckerberg-immigration/\">was a threat to jobs for American women and minorities</a>. Meanwhile, Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon suggested that <a href=\"http://sfist.com/2016/11/16/bannon_asian_ceos.php\">Asians have too much power in Silicon Valley</a>.</p> <p>About a dozen members of Silicon Valley’s elite – including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg – will meet with Trump in New York. The meeting is likely to provide an opportunity for them to highlight their concerns and priorities with the incoming administration.<br /></p> <p>Trump was critical of Silicon Valley business practices during his campaign – from wanting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/23/donald-trump-apple-tim-cook-phone-call-manufacturing-us\">Apple to stop making phones in China</a> to saying Amazon founder Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/13/amazon-getting-away-with-on-tax-says-donald-trump\">exert political power and avoid paying taxes</a>.</p> <p>“If you look at the history of Silicon Valley, it’s clear that drawing on immigrants has been a big part of the vitality, creativity and success of that entrepreneurial melange,” said Marjory Blumenthal, senior policy analyst at <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/\">Rand Corporation</a>.</p> <p>The incoming administration is leaving some highly skilled tech workers nervous about their immigration status. “I am worried that I might have to go back to India,” said Sandeep Purwar, the founder and CEO of the tech recruiting platform <a href=\"http://www.jobants.com/\">JobAnts</a>. He came into the US on an H1B visa but has since gotten a green card. He’s applying for citizenship as soon as possible to secure his position in the US.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of his talk about building a wall and sending back immigrants was to attract Republicans. But he’s a businessman</p> <footer> <cite>Sandeep Purwar</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He hopes that Trump’s pro-business stance will outshine his anti-immigration rhetoric. </p> <p>“During his campaign, a lot of his talk about building a wall and sending back immigrants was to attract and energize the rightwing Republican base. But he’s a businessman. He knows the importance of having manpower in this country, so hopefully he’ll be softening on these policies.”</p> <p>Zoltan Istvan, a futurist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/16/transhumanist-party-immortality-zoltan-istvan-presidential-campaign\">who ran as an independent presidential candidate</a>, said: “It’s in our very best interest to steal the best engineers from over the world and have them live in America,.”</p> <p>Since the election, the Internet Association, a group of technology companies that includes Facebook, Google, Twitter, Netflix and Amazon, has <a href=\"http://internetassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/111416transitionletter.pdf\">written to Trump</a> asking him to support a sector that accounts for 6% of the economy by increasing immigration.</p> <p>“The US immigration system must allow more high-skilled graduates and workers to stay in the United States and contribute to our economy,” the association said in an <a href=\"http://internetassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/111416transitionletter.pdf\">open letter</a>.</p> <p>The letter echoes the demands of <a href=\"http://www.fwd.us/\">Fwd.us</a>, a lobby group set up by tech leaders including Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Eric Schmidt in 2013 to support immigration reform and expand the H1B visa program, which admits 65,000 workers and another 20,000 graduate student workers each year.</p> <p>While Silicon Valley relies on H1B to bring in skilled foreign workers, the immigration scheme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/21/tech-workers-visas-h-1b-reduction-trump-administration\">has also been exploited in a way that drives down wages and in some cases displaces American jobs</a>, said Daniel Costa, of the Economic Policy Institute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"886164b19ad3361edc416c2f028f27516343db90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/886164b19ad3361edc416c2f028f27516343db90/0_573_3431_2059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple CEO Tim Cook will also attend the meeting.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple CEO Tim Cook will also attend the meeting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When tech companies such as Microsoft and Google use H1B as intended – to hire skilled, well-paid foreign workers in short supply – they might also help them get green cards to extend their stays. However, the system is frequently abused, particularly by large contracting firms such as Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/blog/top-h-1b-employers-use-visa-program-for-temporary-labor-not-as-bridge-to-permanent-immigration/\">that use the visas to deploy lower-paid contractors that critics say rarely end up with green cards</a>.</p> <p>This exploitation of the system could be fixed by making sure contractors pay H1B workers a fair wage and advertise all jobs to US workers first, Costa explained. But Silicon Valley tech companies have even lobbied against this. Why? “It’s very possible they have shadow workforces staffed with people from outsourcing companies and they don’t want their labor costs to increase,” Costa said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/17/trump-tech-policy-industry-leaders-apple-china-tax\">Strong-arm Apple and tax China bigly: a guide to Trump\\'s possible tech policies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All of the talk about immigrants taking American jobs ignores another looming challenge: robots or artificial intelligence taking American jobs.</p> <p>“Automation, not immigration, is the bigger issue. AI, software and robots are just starting to destroy the very core economy of America,” Istvan said.</p> <p>“You could try to put legal restrictions on automation but then you can’t create new jobs. It’s a much bigger issue.”</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://robots.stanford.edu/\">Sebastian Thrun</a>, the German-born founder of the educational organization <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/us\">Udacity</a> and a former Google employee, automation won’t eliminate jobs, but will create very different ones. Policymakers and workers have no choice but to embrace the change. “If you try to re-create the past we will be left behind,” he said.</p> <p>He argues that automation will free people from the drudgery of repetitive office work and allow them to become inventors. “We’ll enter an age of unparalleled creativity and innovation.”</p> <p>For Trump’s administration, this will mean shifting away from some of the anti-science rhetoric in order to make America a superpower in science and technology. “We are in a scientific Olympic Games with China, so let’s win this,” said Istvan, who has applied to be an adviser to Trump.</p> <p>“I just hope the vice-president [Mike Pence, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/abortion-vice-presidential-debate-tim-kaine-mike-pence\">isopposed to abortion rights</a> and <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2016/08/17/trump_s_vice_presidential_pick_mike_pence_is_a_creationist.html\">doesn’t believe in evolution</a>] and other more religious candidates don’t get in the way of things like genetic editing or artificial intelligence, which crosses a few religious lines.”</p>',\n",

       "'<p>Weakened and distrusted central governments around the world have been incapable of responding to the way the internet and social media have empowered populist but previously fringe groups, a unique worldwide survey of government communication chiefs has found.</p> <p>The survey spanning 40 countries is the first international review to reveal how deeply governments feel they are losing control and authority over communications.</p> <p>It shows they have been collectively shaken by public distrust of governments, and are struggling to keep pace with how modern voters gather information and form their opinions. The advent of fake news, the dissemination of knowingly inaccurate news, has only deepened the crisis.</p> <p>The study synthesising the responses of more than 300 communication chiefs was undertaken by the advertising and strategy group WPP and steered by a global advisory board spanning Australia, Europe, Asia and America, including leading academics and practitioners in communications, business and the public sector. Prof Ngaire Woods, dean of the Blavatnik school of government at Oxford University, contributed from the UK.</p> <p>The shrinking of the centre’s power and its inability to communicate effectively has fuelled populism, radicalisation and extremism, the survey finds.</p> <p>“When people feel ignored, unheard and unrepresented they turn to alternative sources of information. If governments do not communicate with citizens properly, citizens will go somewhere elsewhere for information,” the report says. </p> <p>The study, entitled Leader’s Report: The Future of Government Communications, finds “the internet has loosened government’s historical and collective grip on trust. It has transformed the role of government as providers of information. Social media has created an echo chamber of information than can filter out opposing views and commentary. </p> <p>“It has created a sense that all information’s free and equal. Citizens find it increasingly easy to communicate with one another, helping once marginalised groups create vocal and powerful social organisations. The technology has fractured audiences and enabled misinformation to be corroborated by anonymous users and politicians alike at ever increasing speeds.” </p> <p>It adds: “Extreme views can appear more mainstream when algorithms amplify them and reflect them back to others with similar views.” </p> <p>Despite this glut of information, the communication managers claim the public feel “more apprehensive than perhaps at any time since the end of the cold war”. The report suggests that “citizens are more powerful than ever in terms of unlimited access to information and can garner support on issues from like-minded individuals faster than the speed with which even the nimblest administration can respond. They have more up-to-date tech than most governments.” </p> <p>The communication chiefs also admit they lack capacity in terms of skills and numbers to be able to connect with citizens, and move to a form of meaningful two-way communication. By contrast governments appear inward-looking and policy-focused.</p> <p>Changes to the media, noticeably the rise of social media, have led to a shrinking of the centre. Groups can establish themselves effectively in opposition to government with very few resources. Such groups do not require the checks and balances that governments need to go through before they respond. </p> <p>One result the study suggests is a more combative relationship between sections of the public and governments.</p> <p>In seeking solutions, the WPP study claims governments face a long haul, but can only respond by being more, not less open, and by providing real-time access to government and those who govern. It suggests they need to do more to distinguish between politicised and government information, and switch from a reliance on mass uniform broadcasting to a more personalised segmented communication.</p> <p> The survey group admits its colleagues in government are not citizen-focused, with only a quarter saying the voice of the citizen is taken into account in key decisions. </p> <p> They complain that communications are seen as little more than a final car wash, the tail end that polishes up a policy that has been produced away from the public or any citizen engagement. </p>'"

       "\"It’s understandable that the world didn’t much care about Gamergate. The 2014 hashtag campaign, ostensibly founded to protest about perceived ethical failures in games journalism, clearly thrived on hate – even though many of those who aligned themselves with the movement either denied there was a problem with harassment, or wrote it off as an unfortunate side effect. Sure, women, minorities and progressive voices within the industry were suddenly living in fear. Sure, those who spoke out in their defence were quickly silenced through exhausting bursts of online abuse. But that wasn’t why people supported it, right? They were disenfranchised, felt ignored, and wanted to see a systematic change. Is this all sounding rather familiar now? Does it remind you of something? If you’re just discovering the world of angry, anonymous online dudes masquerading as victims – hi, come in. Some of us have been here for a while. The similarities between Gamergate and the far-right online movement, the “alt-right”, are huge, startling and in no way a coincidence. After all, the culture war that began in games now has a senior representative in The White House. As a founder member and former executive chair of Brietbart News, Steve Bannon had a hand in creating media monster Milo Yiannopoulos, who built his fame and Twitter following by supporting and cheerleading Gamergate. This hashtag was the canary in the coalmine, and we ignored it.    Brianna Wu was one of women targeted for abuse and death threats. Photograph: Boston Globe/Boston Globe via Getty Images   Lest we forget, Gamergate was an online movement that effectively began because a man wanted to punish his ex girlfriend. Its most notable achievement was harassing a large number of progressive figures - mostly women – to the point where they felt unsafe or considered leaving the industry. Game developer Zoe Quinn was the original target. Anita Sarkeesian’s videos applying basic feminist theory to video games had already made her a target (because so many people have a difficulty differentiating cultural criticism from censorship) but this hate was powerfully amplified by Gamergate – leading to death threats, rape threats, and the public leaking of personal information. Other notable targets included developer Brianna Wu, actor Felicia Day, and prominent tech-culture writer Leigh Alexander, whose provocative article on the tyranny of “game culture” offered stark warnings that still resonate powerfully: “When you decline to create or to curate a culture in your spaces, you’re responsible for what spawns in the vacuum.” Other than harassment, very little was achieved, with tiny changes held aloft as great victories: media publications felt the need to publicly clarify pre-existing ethical measures, others implemented small new additions to account for shifts in the ethical landscape caused by modern funding tools such as Patreon and Kickstarter; games writers were duty bound to declare their support for projects they financially aided in these ways. But it quickly became clear that the GamerGate movement was a mess – an undefined mission to Make Video Games Great Again via undecided means. Many had embraced Gamergate because they felt it wholly matched their ideals, and yet – quite consistently – no one in the movement was willing to be associated with the abuse being carried out in its name. Prominent supporters on Twitter, in subreddits and on forums like 8Chan, developed a range of pernicious rhetorical devices and defences to distance themselves from threats to women and minorities in the industry: the targets were lying or exaggerating, they were too precious; a language of dismissal and belittlement was formed against them. Safe spaces, snowflakes, unicorns, cry bullies. Even when abuse was proven, the usual response was that people on their side were being abused too. These techniques, forged in Gamergate, have become the standard toolset of far-right voices online. In 2014, the media’s reaction was often weak or overtly conciliatory – some sites went out of their way to “see both sides”, to reassure people that openly choosing to be affiliated with a hate group did not make them in any way responsible for that hate. Olive branches were extended, but professional lives continued to be ruined while lukewarm op-eds asked for us to come together so we could start “healing”. The motivations may have been sound, but it’s the language Trump and his supporters have used post-election to obliterate dissenting voices. In 2016, new wave conservative media outlets like Breitbart have gained trust with their audience by painting traditional news sources as snooty and aloof. In 2014, video game YouTube stars, seeking to appear in touch with online gaming communities, unscrupulously proclaimed that traditional old-media sources were corrupt. Everything we’re seeing now, had its precedent two years ago.    Steve Bannon and Donald Trump days before the 2016 US presidential election. Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images   The stark parallels between Gamergate and the political atmosphere of 2016 may come as a surprise, but it shouldn’t: both saw their impact and reach amplified by self-interested parties who underplayed the obvious nastiness they were also promoting. With 2014’s Gamergate, Breitbart seized the opportunity to harness the pre-existing ignorance and anger among disaffected young white dudes. With Trump’s movement in 2016, the outlet was effectively running his campaign: Steve Bannon took leave of his role at the company in August 2016 when he was hired as chief executive of Trump’s presidential campaign. Despite Bannon’s distance from Breitbart in an official capacity, the outlet’s ideology and relentless support of Trump remained unchanged – with editor-in-chief Joel Pollak notably sending an internal memo to staff that ordered them not to support Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields after allegations she was attacked by Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Breitbart’s aspirations to directly influence politics extend a long way into Europe, too – Bannon is openly keen to collaborate with the far-right Marine Le Pen in France, and hired UKIP’s Raheem Hassam to co-run the Breitbart London office. These movements are gaining ground by finding political figures who will legitimise them in return for the support of their swollen online communities. The young men converted via 2014’s Gamergate, are being more widely courted now. By leveraging distrust and resentment towards women, minorities and progressives, many of Gamergate’s most prominent voices – characters like Mike Cernovich, Adam Baldwin, and Milo Yiannopoulos – drew power and influence from its chaos. These figures gave Gamergate a new sense of direction – generalising the rhetoric: this was now a wider war between “Social Justice Warriors” (SJWs) and everyday, normal, decent people. Games were simply the tip of the iceberg – progressive values, went the argument, were destroying everything. The same voices moved into other geek communities, especially comics, where Marvel and DC were criticised for progressive storylines and decisions. They moved into science fiction with the controversy over the Hugo awards. They moved into cinema with the revolting kickback against the all-female Ghostbusters reboot. Despite colonising the world with pointless tech and plastering modern film and TV with fan-pleasing adaptations of niche comic books, nerds still had a taste for revenge. They saw the culture they considered theirs being ripped away from them. In their zero sum mindset, they read growing artistic equality as a threat.    Gamergate figureheads such as Milo Yiannopoulos weren’t taken seriously. Now he is synonymous with Trump and the ‘alt-right’, we have no choice. Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images   For a long time, we didn’t take these characters seriously. Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopoulos in particular seemed such a desperate opportunist that we never predicted his rise to prominence, having explicitly stereotyped gamers in the past as “overweight” and “embarrassing”. A disgraced journalist and entrepreneur who had to close his tech site The Kernel due to unpaid debts, leaving staff uncertain if they would ever be paid, he’d then spent the next few years spouting insincere hateful ideas to a burgeoning Twitter audience who responded to his anti-feminist, anti-establishment invectives. He was eventually banned from the platform after finally abusing a woman who was apparently just famous enough for Twitter to respond. Using 4chan (and then the more sympathetic offshoot 8Chan) to plan their subversions and attacks made Gamergate a terribly sloppy operation, leaving a trail of evidence that made it quite clear the whole thing was purposefully, plainly nasty. But the video game industry didn’t have the spine to react, and allowed the movement to coagulate – forming a mass of spiteful disappointment that Breitbart was only more than happy to coddle. Historically, that seems to be Breitbart’s trick - strongly represent a single issue in order to earn trust, and then gradually indoctrinate to suit wider purposes. With Gamergate, they purposefully went fishing for anti-feminists. 2016’s batch of fresh converts – the white extremists – came from enticing conspiracy theories about the global neoliberal elite secretly controlling the world. The greatest strength of Gamergate, though, was that it actually appeared to represent many left-leaning ideals: stamping out corruption in the press, pushing for better ethical practices, battling for openness. There are similarities here with many who support Trump because of his promises to put an end to broken neo-liberalism, to “drain the swamp” of establishment corruption. Many left-leaning supporters of Gamergate sought to intellectualise their alignment with the hashtag, adopting familiar and acceptable labels of dissent – identifying as libertarian, egalitarian, humanist. At best they unknowingly facilitated abuse, defending their own freedom of expression while those who actually needed support were threatened and attacked. Genuine discussions over criticism, identity and censorship were paralysed and waylaid by Twitter voices obsessed with rhetorical fallacies and pedantic debating practices. While the core of these movements make people’s lives hell, the outer shell – knowingly or otherwise – protect abusers by insisting that the real problem is that you don’t want to talk, or won’t provide the ever-shifting evidence they politely require.    As with Trump, Gamergate appeared to represent many left-leaning ideals such as stamping out corruption and pushing for better ethical practices. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP   The beauty of this anti-establishment standpoint is, when any mainstream media source seeks to challenge the collective beliefs of the movement, it’s merely used as further evidence that journalists are untrustworthy and aloof. This is a challenge the press must be ready to face in today’s political climate: confronting these movements comes with a cost – it has never been possible to write openly about Gamergate without attracting a wave of online abuse. In 2017, the tactics used to discredit progressive game critics and developers will be used to discredit Trump and Bannon’s critics. There will be gaslighting, there will be attempts to make victims look as though they are losing their grip on reality, to the point that they gradually even start to believe it. The “post-truth” reality is not simply an accident – it is a concerted assault on the rational psyche. The strangest aspect of Gamergate is that it consistently didn’t make any sense: people chose to align with it, and yet refused responsibility. It was constantly demanded that we debate the issues, but explanations and facts were treated with scorn. Attempts to find common ground saw the specifics of the demands being shifted: we want you to listen to us; we want you to change your ways; we want you to close your publication down. This movement that ostensibly wanted to protect free speech from cry bully SJWs simultaneously did what it could to endanger sites it disagreed with, encouraging advertisers to abandon support for media outlets that published stories critical of the hashtag. The petulance of that movement is disturbingly echoed in Trump’s own Twitter feed. Looking back, Gamergate really only made sense in one way: as an exemplar of what Umberto Eco called “eternal fascism”, a form of extremism he believed could flourish at any point in, in any place – a fascism that would extol traditional values, rally against diversity and cultural critics, believe in the value of action above thought and encourage a distrust of intellectuals or experts – a fascism built on frustration and machismo. The requirement of this formless fascism would – above all else – be to remain in an endless state of conflict, a fight against a foe who must always be portrayed as impossibly strong and laughably weak. This was the methodology of Gamergate, and it now forms the basis of the contemporary far-right movement.   Related: 'Alt-right': why the Guardian decided not to ban use of the term   We have no idea where this will lead, but our continued insistence on shrugging off the problems of the internet as “not real” – as something we can just log out of – is increasingly misled. 2016 has presented us with a world in which our reality is being wilfully manipulated. Fake news, divisive algorithms, misleading social media campaigns. The majority of people who voted for Trump will never take responsibility for his racist, totalitarian policies, but they’ll provide useful cover and legitimacy for those who demand the very worst from the President Elect. Trump himself may have disavowed the “alt-right”, but his rhetoric has led to them feeling legitimised. As with Gamergate, the press risks being manipulated into a position where it has to tread a respectful middle ground that doesn’t really exist. Prominent critics of the Trump administration need to learn from Gamergate. They need to be prepared for abuse, for falsified concerns, invented grassroots campaigns designed specifically to break, belittle, or disgrace. Words and concepts will be twisted, repackaged and shared across forums, stripping them of meaning. Gamergate painted critics as censors, the far-right movement claims critics are the real racists. Perhaps the true lesson of Gamergate was that the media is culturally unequipped to deal with the forces actively driving these online movements. The situation was horrifying enough two years ago, it is many times more dangerous now.\""
